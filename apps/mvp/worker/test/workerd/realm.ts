// The Worker worker/ci/Realm.workerd.test.ts runs in local workerd (Miniflare), bundled the way Alchemy bundles ChatApi:
// a repository flow's source, posted as the request's body, planned in the realm (worker/ci/Realm.ts) over the QuickJS
// build the Worker carries (worker/AgentSandbox.ts `variant`), exactly as `repo/Plan` plans it on Cloudflare.
//
// This file is the program boundary: it runs Effects with `Effect.runPromise`.
