// with the headers it gives them, any other outside page is unreachable, and this machine (Electric, a local test
// server) is the real fetch. Outside sites are a third party, like the model provider, so they are scripted; ChatApi,
// `@smthrs/views`' check and Effect's fetch client all run for real. The end-to-end tests serve real pages instead
