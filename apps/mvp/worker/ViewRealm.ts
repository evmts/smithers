// module runs, and nowhere else. `@smthrs/views`' `PresentationRealm` loads `@smthrs/ui`'s presentation bundle (React,
// `renderToStaticMarkup` and the audited component subset) into QuickJS, and each render and move gets a fresh runtime
// with no clock, network, storage or host object, bounded in time, steps, memory and output.
//
// On Cloudflare the realm runs on the build whose `.wasm` the bundler compiled, as the agent's cell sandbox does
// (worker/AgentSandbox.ts): workerd refuses to compile WebAssembly from bytes. Node, in the tests, loads the same build's
// `.wasm` file from disk.
