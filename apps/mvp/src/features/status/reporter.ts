// How a run's steps report its status (decision 0015 §2): from inside a step, to the run's `runs` row through ChatApi.
// The run is the execution's requester (src/flows/requests.ts): `chat/Answer`'s own id, or the answer an agent's call
// belongs to (`<answerId>/chat/Respond@…/call/<frame>.<ordinal>`, src/flows/catalog.ts). A report is part of the durable step that makes it, so a
// step run again after a crash reports again, which the route takes as no change.
//
// `report` never fails: a status that can't land must not fail the answer, and the conversation reads the answer's
// own settled status first (src/features/status/queries.ts). It skips a report this engine already sent for the run,
// so a step that retries while it waits (`chat/LoadTurn`) reports `waiting` once. `reportOrFail` is for the one report
// a step can't go on without: the question, which the person can't answer unless they see it.
