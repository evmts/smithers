/**
 * What a person sees when something fails: one plain sentence, whose fault it
 * is, and the buttons that can fix it.
 *
 * Every failure a surface can show is a tagged error (`Schema.TaggedError` or
 * `Data.TaggedError`, so it carries `_tag`). A surface lists the tags it can
 * receive in a `UserFailureRegistry`, a mapped type over the tag union: a tag
 * with no entry does not compile, and neither does an entry for a tag the
 * union lacks. Exception detail is redacted before it reaches any surface;
 * a collapsed Details control is still a disclosure of that text.
 *
 * An error with no registered tag is unknown. It gets one generic sentence,
 * the surface's fallback actions, and a report to `onUnknown`, and its message
 * never becomes the sentence.
 *
 * The fault classes are `PlueFault`, the one taxonomy every refusal already
 * uses; there is no second model.
