// What a page that shows a repository loads first. A consumer's bundler splits at dynamic imports, so the views'
// entry carries React, pierre and Shiki's engine, while the Milkdown editor, Shiki's grammars and themes, and the
// VibeLang grammar load only when a view needs them. The bundle runs in a fresh Bun process: an in-process
// `Bun.build` shares the test runner's file cache and reads crossed content (see @smthrs/ui's barrel-weight test).
