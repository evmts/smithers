# Code Review for Commit a7c9a55

**Date:** 2026-01-18 13:36:32
**Commit Message:** test commit

### Summary

This commit is contradictory. It adds a new code review file that correctly warns against deleting historical review documents, yet in the same commit, it deletes `reviews/serializer-edge-cases.md`, a file that documents important, and likely unresolved, technical issues. The commit message "test commit" provides no rationale for this deletion.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Deletion of `reviews/serializer-edge-cases.md`**:
    *   This file documents valid, open issues with the XML serializer (`src/reconciler/serialize.ts`), including how it handles circular object references and how indentation affects text content.
    *   Deleting this file removes the only record of these known bugs without any corresponding code changes to fix them. This loses important context and increases the risk that the issues will be forgotten.

2.  **Contradictory Action**:
    *   The commit adds `reviews/20260118_133559_9439558.md`, which astutely points out the risks of deleting review documents containing unresolved feedback.
    *   By deleting `reviews/serializer-edge-cases.md`, the commit engages in the exact practice that the newly added review criticizes.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Restore `reviews/serializer-edge-cases.md`**: This file should be restored and should only be removed after the serialization issues it describes have been fixed and verified.
*   **Improve Commit Hygiene**: The commit message should be descriptive. Furthermore, adding a review and deleting a separate, unrelated file should be done in separate commits. The current commit should be split into two: one to add the new review, and another (which should be reverted) that handles the deletion.
