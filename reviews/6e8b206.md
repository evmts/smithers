# Review: 6e8b206

**Commit:** 6e8b20644d846b1122afd84b82981348c25ee243
**Message:** fix: rename package from 'smithers' to '@evmts/smithers' for npm publication
**Date:** 2026-01-08 11:59:59 UTC

## Feedback

- docs/examples still import subpath `smithers/mcp`, which will be wrong after scoping; update to `@evmts/smithers/mcp` in files like `docs/examples/08-mcp-filesystem.mdx`, `docs/examples/10-mcp-integration.mdx`, and `docs/examples/10-tool-composition.mdx` to avoid broken imports for users.  
- `PUBLISH_CHECKLIST.md` still links to `https://www.npmjs.com/package/smithers`; update to the scoped package page to avoid confusion.
