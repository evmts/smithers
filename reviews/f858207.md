# Review: f858207

**Commit:** f858207501b01aaf3b9a48fa6db0d5d5aa5764b3
**Message:** docs: final production readiness verification
**Date:** 2026-01-08 04:50:13 UTC

## Feedback

In `bash/important-memories.md`, the verification claims “663 passing tests, 2 skipped” but also says “99.7% pass rate” and earlier in the commit message says “663 passing, 99.7% pass rate” without mentioning skips. Please reconcile the test numbers/skip count so the documentation is internally consistent.
