# Review: f0f029c

**Commit:** f0f029c6efc2062a0b5bbb47997c45e6691c2759
**Message:** feat: implement interactive CLI commands (Phase 4)
**Date:** 2026-01-07 01:45:23 UTC

## Feedback

- `src/cli/interactive.ts:94` `/status` undercounts pending nodes because it only treats `node._execution.status === 'pending'` as pending; most pending nodes have `node._execution` undefined (see `findPendingExecutables`). Treat missing `_execution` as pending or set pending status during render so `/status` is accurate.
- `src/core/execute.ts:160` `/abort` only checks at frame boundaries; it won’t interrupt a long-running node, contradicting docs claiming immediate stop. Either add cancellation checks during node execution / in executors or update `docs/cli-commands.md` to reflect “after current node/frame.”
