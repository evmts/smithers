# Code Review for Commit 9f17c07

**Date:** 2026-01-18 20:38:51
**Commit Message:** Implement actual tests for hooks (useRalphCount, useHuman, useCaptureRenderFrame, index)

---

### Summary

The commit adds a solid set of well-written and comprehensive tests for the `useRalphCount`, `useHuman`, `useCaptureRenderFrame` hooks and the main `hooks/index` barrel file. The tests are well-structured, covering initialization, reactivity, error handling, edge cases, and cleanup.

The core code changes are excellent. However, there is a significant commit hygiene issue: an unrelated, generated review file is included in the commit.

### Specific Issues Found

-   **Bundling Unrelated Changes**:
    -   **File**: `reviews/20260118_203407_4e3c533.md`
    -   **Issue**: The commit adds a new markdown file that appears to be a code review for a completely different commit (`4e3c533`). Bundling generated artifacts or unrelated files into a feature commit clutters the history and violates the principle of atomic commits, where each commit represents a single logical change.

### Suggested Improvements

-   **Split the Commit**: The commit should be amended to remove the unrelated review file (`reviews/20260118_203407_4e3c533.md`). The test files themselves are a perfect, self-contained change and should be committed on their own. The generated review file, if it must be tracked, should be part of a different commit or process.
