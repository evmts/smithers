## Feedback

- Possible type mismatch: `src/core/claude-executor.ts` now imports/uses `SmithersNode` instead of `PluNode` across the file. If `./types.js` doesn’t export `SmithersNode` (or it’s not structurally compatible), this will break type checking/builds. Please confirm the type rename was intentional and update `./types.js` (or revert to `PluNode`) accordingly.
