## Feedback

A few doc accuracy/maintainability concerns:

- `NEXT-STEPS.md:1` uses non-ASCII emoji in the title; if the repo standard is ASCII-only docs, replace with plain text.
- `NEXT-STEPS.md:12` and `bash/important-memories.md:4612` hardcode counts (“663 tests”, “72+ files”, “5.6 MB tarball”, “12 examples”) and absolute claims (“ONLY blocker”, “100% complete”). These will go stale; consider softening language or pointing to the commands to verify instead of fixed numbers.
- `bash/important-memories.md:4631` includes specific GitHub Actions run IDs and timestamps; this is likely to become outdated and noisy. Consider removing or summarizing without run IDs.
