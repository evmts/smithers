# Code Review for Commit 3d277fc

**Date:** 2026-01-18 21:14:01
**Commit Message:** chore: Remove closed docs review files

---

### Summary

The commit message is incomplete and misleading. It states that "closed docs review files" are being removed, which only accounts for the deletion of `reviews/db-sql-injection-memories-search.md`. It completely omits that a new review file, `reviews/20260118_211316_66e22bd.md`, is also being added. Commits should accurately represent their changes to maintain a clear and trustworthy version history.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Inaccurate Commit Message**:
    -   The commit message `chore: Remove closed docs review files` is inaccurate because it only describes the file deletion. It fails to mention the addition of a new file (`reviews/20260118_211316_66e22bd.md`), making the summary of the change misleading.

2.  **Mixed Concerns**:
    -   The commit combines two unrelated actions: adding a new code review for a past commit and removing a different, presumably resolved, review file. Bundling unrelated changes into a single commit makes the history harder to read and understand.

### Suggested Improvements

1.  **Split the Commit**: For better repository hygiene, this change should be split into two separate, atomic commits with accurate messages:
    -   **Commit 1 (Deletion)**: Create a commit that only contains the deletion of the old review file.
        ```
        chore: Remove resolved review for db-sql-injection
        ```
    -   **Commit 2 (Addition)**: Create a second commit that only contains the addition of the new review file.
        ```
        docs: Add code review for commit 66e22bd
        ```

2.  **Amend the Commit Message**: If splitting the commit is not feasible, the current commit message should be amended to accurately reflect both changes. For example:
    ```
    chore: Update code reviews

    - Add review for commit 66e22bd
    - Remove resolved review for db-sql-injection-memories-search
    ```
