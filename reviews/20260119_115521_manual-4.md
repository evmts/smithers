# Review: render() hides render errors

sev: low
file: src/reconciler/root.ts:136-158

issue: render resolves regardless; errors only logged in createContainer handlers.
flow: error -> console.error -> resolve Promise -> tests pass despite failures.

risk: unit tests using render() miss failures.
fix: track errors like mount() or reject on onUncaughtError/onCaughtError.
