## Feedback

The added status report contains internal inconsistencies that undermine its accuracy.

- `bash/important-memories.md`: counts don’t match across sections (e.g., tests listed as 663/665 then “665 tests” and “99.7% pass rate”; docs 73 files then 74; examples 17 files then 18). Pick one set of numbers and keep them consistent, or explain the difference (e.g., new files added after the initial count).
