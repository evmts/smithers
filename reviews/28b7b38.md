## Feedback

Potential issue: `analysis` inside `onFinished` can be stale if multiple callbacks resolve out of order; using `const updated = [...(analysis || []), result]` can drop results. Use functional updates and compute length from the next state, or drive the phase change from a `useEffect` on `analysis` length.
