## Feedback

- `bash/important-memories.md:5401`–`bash/important-memories.md:5412` vs `bash/important-memories.md:5430` and `bash/important-memories.md:5451` contradict each other (10 commits ahead + needs push vs “all commits pushed/synced”). Reconcile these or consolidate into a single, consistent status entry so the log doesn’t conflict.
- `bash/important-memories.md:5444` and `bash/important-memories.md:5506`–`bash/important-memories.md:5510` make absolute, forward-looking claims (“100% production-ready”, “no remaining work”, “only npm auth needed”). These will go stale quickly; scope them to a specific commit/time or rephrase as time-bound observations to avoid misleading future readers.
