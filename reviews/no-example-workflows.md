# No Example Workflows

## Status: MEDIUM PRIORITY

## Summary
The README has a placeholder for a demo GIF but no runnable example workflows are provided. Users cannot easily understand how to use Smithers or manually test it.

## Impact
- No way to manually test the framework works
- New users have no starting point
- Marketing/documentation incomplete

## Evidence
README mentions demo but no actual examples exist in the repository.

## Suggested Fix
1. Create `examples/` directory
2. Add 2-3 example workflows:
   - Simple single-phase Claude execution
   - Multi-phase workflow with Ralph loop
   - Code review workflow
3. Add manual testing guide in README
4. Include expected output/behavior

## Priority
**P2** - Important for adoption and testing

## Estimated Effort
4-6 hours
