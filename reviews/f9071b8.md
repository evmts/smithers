**Message:** fix: mark Claude nodes with failed worktree ancestors as errored
**Date:** 2026-01-07 00:05:04 UTC

## Feedback

Issue:
- `src/core/execute.ts:1366` marking Claude nodes as `error` with a stable `contentHash` means they will never re-execute after the worktree failure is fixed (the hash won’t change, so the “content changed” re-run path won’t trigger). Consider clearing `_execution`, setting `status: 'pending'`, or recording a `blockedByWorktree` marker and re-queuing when the ancestor is no longer failed. Alternatively, omit `contentHash` for this error so the next run forces re-execution.
