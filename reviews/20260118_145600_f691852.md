# Code Review for Commit f691852

**Date:** 2026-01-18 14:56:00
**Commit Message:** test commit

---

### Summary

This commit has significant issues with its structure and commit message, a practice often referred to as poor "commit hygiene." It bundles a documentation/review file with a functional refactoring of core hooks, all under the uninformative commit message "test commit".

Ironically, the new review file being added (`reviews/20260118_145053_70191de.md`) criticizes another commit for these exact same anti-patterns: bundling unrelated changes and using a meaningless commit message.

While the underlying code changes to the `useQueryOne` and `useQueryValue` hooks are a clear improvement, they should not be included in the same commit as documentation.

### Issues Found

1.  **Meaningless Commit Message**
    - The commit message "test commit" provides no context for the changes, making it difficult for future developers to understand the history of the codebase.

2.  **Poor Commit Cohesion (Bundling Unrelated Changes)**
    - **File:** `reviews/20260118_145053_70191de.md`
    - **Files:** `src/reactive-sqlite/hooks/useQueryOne.ts`, `src/reactive-sqlite/hooks/useQueryValue.ts`
    - **Issue:** The commit mixes two distinct concerns: adding a code review document and refactoring the argument parsing for reactive query hooks. These changes are unrelated and should be in separate, atomic commits. This practice makes the git history hard to read, bisect, or revert.

### Suggested Improvements

The commit must be split into two separate, focused commits, each with a clear and descriptive message.

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Commit 1: `docs: Add code review for commit 70191de`**
    - **Scope:** This commit should only include the new markdown file.
    - **Files:**
        - `reviews/20260118_145053_70191de.md`

2.  **Commit 2: `refactor(reactive-sqlite): Improve argument parsing in query hooks`**
    - **Scope:** This commit should contain the refactoring of the hooks. The commit message should explain that this change improves the robustness of function overload detection by using a type guard (`isDb`) to reliably differentiate between database instances and options objects.
    - **Files:**
        - `src/reactive-sqlite/hooks/useQueryOne.ts`
        - `src/reactive-sqlite/hooks/useQueryValue.ts`
