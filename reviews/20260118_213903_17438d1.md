**Commit Message:** chore: close resolved review files

---

### Summary

This commit has several issues. The commit message, "chore: close resolved review files," is inaccurate as it bundles multiple, unrelated changes, including a significant feature addition and the erroneous inclusion of a new review artifact. Commits should be atomic and accurately described.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Inaccurate Commit Message**: The commit message only describes the deletion of several files in the `reviews/` directory. It completely omits the most significant change, which is the addition of dozens of custom JSX type definitions in `src/jsx.d.ts`. It is also contradicted by the addition of a new file to the `reviews/` directory.

2.  **Mixing Unrelated Concerns**: The commit is not atomic and bundles several distinct changes that should be in separate commits:
    *   **Feature**: A large number of custom JSX intrinsic elements are added in `src/jsx.d.ts`. This appears to be part of a new feature for creating a declarative, XML-like DSL for orchestration. This should be in its own feature commit (e.g., `feat: Add custom JSX types for orchestration DSL`).
    *   **Chore**: Old review files are deleted. This is a cleanup task.
    *   **Artifact**: A new review file, `reviews/20260118_210306_39948b0.md`, is being added. This seems to be a generated artifact that was committed by mistake. Such files generally do not belong in the repository.
    *   **Refactor**: A minor type change was made in `examples/stacked-pr-merge/types.ts`.

3.  **Committing Generated Artifacts**:
    *   **File**: `reviews/20260118_210306_39948b0.md`
    *   **Issue**: This file appears to be a generated code review report. Committing such artifacts adds noise to the repository and is not a standard practice. These should typically be excluded via `.gitignore`.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Split the commit into multiple, focused commits:**
    1.  A feature commit for the changes to `src/jsx.d.ts`.
        *   **Suggested Message:** `feat: Add custom JSX types for orchestration DSL`
    2.  A chore commit for the deletion of the old review files and the minor type tweak in `examples/stacked-pr-merge/types.ts`.
        *   **Suggested Message:** `chore: Remove resolved review files`
*   **Do not commit the new review file** (`reviews/20260118_210306_39948b0.md`).
*   **Consider adding the `reviews/` directory to `.gitignore`** to prevent generated review files from being accidentally committed in the future.
