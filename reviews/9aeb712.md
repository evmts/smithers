## Feedback

- `evals/output-file-components.test.tsx`: `onError callback on failure` uses hard-coded `/nonexistent-root-dir-test/...`, which is Unix-specific and may pass on privileged environments; make it platform-safe (e.g., use a temp dir + chmod to remove write perms, or mock fs to throw) and handle Windows paths.
- `evals/output-file-components.test.tsx`: several tests execute `<Claude>` without forcing mock mode; if an API key is set in CI/dev, this can trigger real network calls or failures. Explicitly pass `mockMode: true` or stub the Claude client in these tests.
- `evals/output-file-components.test.tsx`: `mock mode` test has no assertions, so it can’t fail; assert the file doesn’t exist or that `onWritten` isn’t called.
