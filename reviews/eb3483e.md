**Message:** ✨ feat(core): route execution to Agent SDK by default
**Date:** 2026-01-06 01:31:14 UTC

## Feedback

- `src/core/execute.ts`: Agent SDK error handling only throws when `!success && error`. If the SDK returns `success: false` without an error string, this node is treated as successful with `output = ''`, which hides failures. Consider throwing on any `!success` (use a generic message when `error` is absent).
- `src/core/execute.ts`: `onPlanWithPrompt` computes `executablePaths` from `planNodes`, but `planXml` can fall back to `plan` when `planNodes` is empty. This yields empty `executablePaths` even when there are pending executables. Consider deriving executable paths from the same source as `planXml` (or from `pendingNodes`) to keep the callback consistent.
