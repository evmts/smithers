# Review: 31b3108

**Commit:** 31b3108dd3ca880cd4f74bcfd10bec613ff7a55d
**Message:** docs: fix test count documentation inconsistency
**Date:** 2026-01-08 04:53:28 UTC

## Feedback

- `bash/ralph-prompt.md`: “**35 test files**” conflicts with “**And 16+ more test files**” which implies >35 total. Either drop the 35 count or make the list explicitly total to 35.  
- `bash/ralph-prompt.md`: “663 tests pass (2 skipped, 0 failing)” is ambiguous because skipped tests usually aren’t counted as passing. Consider “663 total (661 passing, 2 skipped, 0 failing)” or similar for clarity.
