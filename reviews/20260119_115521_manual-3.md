# Review: warnings walker crashes on null/undefined children

sev: medium
file: src/reconciler/serialize.ts:100-102

issue: addWarningsForUnknownParents recurses raw children; null/undefined => runtime error.
flow: child=null -> addWarningsForUnknownParents(null) -> .warnings access -> throw.

risk: serialize() crashes if tree has nulls (possible from manual nodes/tests).
fix: filter children before recursion or guard in addWarningsForUnknownParents.
