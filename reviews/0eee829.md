# Review: 0eee829

**Commit:** 0eee829e796bee4f9a1ed14a940fb05ab94d9b35
**Message:** docs: update important-memories with production ready status
**Date:** 2026-01-07 02:44:42 UTC

## Feedback

The “PRODUCTION READY” label conflicts with the remaining ⚠️ items (notably the unverified npm publish). Either downgrade the status or explicitly state that release readiness still depends on completing the publish verification.
