## Feedback

- `src/cli/interactive.ts:110` `/status` now treats `running` nodes as `pending`, so the “Pending Nodes” list can include nodes that `/skip` can’t actually skip (since `findPendingExecutables` excludes running). Either exclude `running` from `pendingNodes` or add a separate “Running Nodes” section/count so the output isn’t misleading.
