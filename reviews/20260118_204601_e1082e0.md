# Code Review for Commit e1082e0

**Date:** 2026-01-18 20:46:01
**Commit Message:** fix(vcs): use @- reference in jjCommit for correct change ID

---

### Summary

The commit is highly problematic. The commit message is entirely inaccurate and bears no relation to the files being changed. The changes themselves—adding one review file and deleting another—appear unrelated and are bundled together under a misleading `fix(vcs)` scope. This suggests a potential mistake during staging.

### Specific Issues Found

-   **Incorrect Commit Message**: The commit message is `fix(vcs): use @src/monitor/haiku-summarizer.ts reference in jjCommit for correct change ID`. However, the actual changes do not involve any modifications to version control logic (`jjCommit`) or the haiku summarizer. The changes are confined to the `reviews/` directory.

-   **Poor Commit Hygiene**: The commit bundles two seemingly unrelated changes:
    -   **File Added**: `reviews/20260118_204458_120a444.md`
    -   **File Deleted**: `reviews/hooks-usePrevious-missing-deps.md`
    -   **Issue**: Atomic commits should contain a single logical change. Adding one review and deleting another are distinct actions and should not be grouped together, especially under a completely unrelated commit message. This makes the commit history difficult to understand and track.

### Suggested Improvements

1.  **Correct the Commit**: The commit should be undone and re-committed correctly. The developer should verify which changes were intended.

2.  **Split the Changes**: If both the file addition and deletion were intentional, they should be in separate commits with accurate messages.
    -   A potential commit for the added file: `docs(review): add review for commit 120a444`
    -   A potential commit for the deleted file: `docs(review): remove obsolete usePrevious hook review`

3.  **Verify Staging**: It is highly likely these changes were staged by mistake. The developer should use `git status` and `git diff --staged` to ensure only the intended files are included before committing.
