# Code Review for Commit 2d555c4

**Commit Message:** chore: Remove remaining docs review files

---

### Summary

The commit has a fundamentally incorrect and misleading commit message. The message claims that files are being removed, but the commit actually adds three new files. Additionally, one of the new test files contains placeholder tests that provide no actual test coverage, which can be deceptive.

### Specific Issues Found

-   **Incorrect Commit Message**: The commit message is `chore: Remove remaining docs review files`. However, the commit *adds* the following files, it does not remove any:
    -   `reviews/20260118_211427_8b432ba.md`
    -   `src/tui/components/shared/ScrollableList.test.tsx`
    -   `src/tui/components/shared/XMLViewer.test.tsx`
    This is the opposite of the action described in the commit message, making the git history confusing and unreliable.

-   **Incomplete/Placeholder Tests**: The new test file for the `ScrollableList` component contains placeholder tests that do not actually test the component's functionality.
    -   **File**: `src/tui/components/shared/ScrollableList.test.tsx`
    -   **Lines**: 31-43
    -   **Details**: Tests under the "default values" describe block, such as `'height defaults to 10'`, only assert `expect(typeof ScrollableList).toBe('function')`. This does not test the default prop value or any component behavior, rendering the test useless and misleading. The same issue exists for other tests in this file.

### Suggested Improvements

-   **Correct the Commit Message**: The commit message must be amended to accurately reflect the changes. A more appropriate message would be something like: `test: Add initial tests for XMLViewer and ScrollableList`.

-   **Implement or Remove Placeholder Tests**: The tests in `src/tui/components/shared/ScrollableList.test.tsx` should be fully implemented to validate the component's props and behavior. If they are not ready to be implemented, they should be removed to avoid giving a false sense of test coverage.

-   **Split the Commit**: The commit combines unrelated changes (a code review file and tests for two different components). For better history tracking, consider splitting these into separate, atomic commits with clear messages for each.
