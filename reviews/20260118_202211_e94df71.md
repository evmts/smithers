# Code Review for Commit e94df71

**Date:** 2026-01-18 20:22:11
**Commit Message:** feat: add stacked-pr-merge workflow example

Demonstrates multi-phase workflow for merging worktree PRs:
- Phase 1: Status - gather worktree/PR status, identify candidates
- Phase 2: Order - determine merge order by size/dependencies
- Phase 3: Rebase - rebase into linear stacked history
- Phase 4: Merge - cherry-pick to main, close PRs

Components split into own files:
- 4 phase components in components/
- 4 custom hooks in hooks/
- Types and entry point

---

### Summary

The new `README.md` for the `stacked-pr-merge` example is excellent. It is well-structured, comprehensive, and clearly explains the architecture, usage, and underlying patterns of the new workflow example.

### Issues

*   **Incomplete Commit**: The provided change for commit `e94df71` only includes the documentation file (`examples/stacked-pr-merge/README.md`). The commit message ("feat: add stacked-pr-merge workflow example") and the content of the README itself imply that a full working example with multiple source files should be included. The implementation files (like `index.tsx`, `*.tsx` components, and `*.ts` hooks) are missing from this diff. A feature commit should contain the implementation alongside its documentation.

### Suggested Improvements

*   Include the source code for the `stacked-pr-merge` example in this commit to make it a complete and functional feature addition. If the files are in a separate commit, it would be better to squash them together to form a single, atomic feature commit.
