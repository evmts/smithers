# Code Review for Commit 27abd56

**Date:** 2026-01-18 21:26:45
**Commit Message:** chore: delete processed review files (all already fixed)

---

### Summary

This commit's stated purpose is to delete processed review files. However, it also introduces two significant and unmentioned changes: adding a new review document and enhancing the `scripts/export-codebase.ts` script. Ironically, the newly added review file (`reviews/20260118_212615_ce92eba.md`) criticizes another commit for having the exact same issues this commit has: an inaccurate commit message and mixed concerns.

### Issues Found

-   **Inaccurate Commit Message**: The commit message `chore: delete processed review files (all already fixed)` is incomplete and therefore misleading. It omits the addition of a new, detailed code review and the feature enhancements made to the codebase export script.
-   **Mixed Concerns**: The commit combines three distinct and unrelated actions into one, making the repository history difficult to track and understand:
    1.  **Chore (Deletion)**: Removing five old review files from the `reviews/` directory.
    2.  **Chore (Addition)**: Adding a new code review file (`reviews/20260118_212615_ce92eba.md`).
    3.  **Feat (Enhancement)**: Improving the `scripts/export-codebase.ts` script with new file type support (`.mdx`), categorized help output, and the ability to export test files.

### Suggested Improvements

To maintain a clean and logical git history, these changes should be split into separate, atomic commits, each with a clear and descriptive message.

1.  A `chore` commit for managing the review files. This could be one or two commits, but the message should be accurate.
    ```
    chore(reviews): Remove 5 resolved review documents
    ```
    ```
    chore(reviews): Add code review for commit ce92eba
    ```

2.  A `feat` or `chore` commit for the script enhancement, as it adds new functionality:
    ```
    feat(scripts): Enhance codebase export script

    - Adds support for `.mdx` files.
    - Improves the `--help` output by categorizing sections (Source, Docs, Tests).
    - Adds logic to selectively include test files in exports.
    ```
