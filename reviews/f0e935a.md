**Message:** 🐛 fix: use stable node paths for execution state tracking
**Date:** 2026-01-05 23:28:01 UTC

## Feedback

Potential issue:
- `restoreExecutionState` now requires `savedState.contentHash` to match, but `saveExecutionState` doesn’t ensure `node._execution.contentHash` is set. If `_execution` lacks `contentHash` (e.g., older states or certain execution paths), restore will always skip. Consider computing/storing `contentHash` when saving (e.g., set `node._execution.contentHash = computeContentHash(node)` before `storage.set`).
