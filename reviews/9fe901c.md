## Feedback

The wording is still contradictory: “707 tests passing” alongside “20 failures” reads as mutually exclusive. Clarify the total test count and explicitly split “Smithers-only” vs “bundled OpenTUI SolidJS” results (e.g., “Smithers: 707 pass, 2 skip, 0 fail; OpenTUI SolidJS: 20 fail”). Also, “All 707 Smithers tests passing (619 core …)” is confusing—either 707 are Smithers tests or 619 are; fix the counts so they don’t conflict.
