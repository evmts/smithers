## Feedback

Not LGTM.

- `docs/examples/feature-workflow.mdx:161-285` The example treats `onFinished` results as structured objects (`result.files`, `result.analysis`, `result.refinedPlan`) but those phases don’t include an `<OutputFormat>` to enforce/shape JSON output. In practice this often yields plain text, so these fields become `undefined` and the workflow breaks/degenerates. Add `<OutputFormat schema={...}>` for `ResearchPhase`, `POCPhase`, and `POCAnalysisPhase` (matching the real `examples/00-feature-workflow/agent.tsx`) or change the handlers to parse freeform strings.
