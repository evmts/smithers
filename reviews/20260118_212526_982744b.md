# Code Review for Commit 982744b

**Date:** 2026-01-18 21:25:26
**Commit Message:** chore: close resolved review docs (reactive_sqlite, issue_dependency_map)

---

### Summary

This commit's stated purpose is to remove old review documents. However, it also includes a major documentation-wide refactoring to reflect API changes (deprecating `<Orchestration>`, changing DB method signatures) and deletes many more files than mentioned. The actual code and documentation changes appear to be correct and represent an improvement, but they are not reflected in the commit message.

### Issues

-   **Inaccurate Commit Message**: The commit message `chore: close resolved review docs (reactive_sqlite, issue_dependency_map)` drastically under-represents the scope of the changes. The large-scale documentation and API changes, which are the most significant part of the commit, are completely unmentioned. This makes the git history difficult to follow and understand.

-   **Mixed Concerns**: Housekeeping (deleting old review files) is mixed with a major refactoring of the documentation and API examples. These changes should be in separate, focused commits to maintain a clean and logical project history.

### Suggested Improvements

-   **Split the Commit**: The changes should be split into at least two separate commits:
    1.  A `refactor(docs)` or `docs(api)` commit for all the documentation changes related to replacing `<Orchestration>` and updating API call signatures.
    2.  A `chore(reviews)` commit for deleting the old review documents.

-   **Improve Commit Message**: If splitting is not an option, the commit message should be rewritten to accurately reflect all the changes. For example:

    ```
    refactor(docs): Deprecate Orchestrator and update API usage

    - Replaces the `<Orchestration>` component with `<SmithersProvider>` across all documentation examples. Props are moved to the provider.
    - Updates database method calls (e.g., `db.phases.list`, `db.state.history`) to use a single options object for arguments.
    - Updates examples to use modern data-fetching patterns (`useQueryValue`).
