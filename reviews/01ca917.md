**Commit:** 01ca9177c4dd9b176214b130f9c3e00e99c1a0a5
**Message:** ✅ test: add comprehensive CLI test coverage (34 tests)
**Date:** 2026-01-06 00:47:15 UTC

## Feedback

- `evals/cli.test.ts:363`: `--dry-run` test doesn’t actually prove execution didn’t run because it checks for lowercase `'Execution complete'`; if the CLI prints `'Execution Complete'`, the test will still pass. Use a case‑insensitive check or assert the exact completion string is absent.
- `evals/cli.test.ts:233` and `evals/cli.test.ts:543`: JSON extraction via `/\{[\s\S]*\}/` is greedy and can capture extra braces from info/log lines, making the tests flaky or parsing the wrong blob. Prefer parsing the last non-empty line, or adjust CLI `--json` to emit only JSON and parse the full stdout.
