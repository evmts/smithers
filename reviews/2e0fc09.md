**Message:** ✨ feat(workflow): implement createWorkflow with reactive store

## Feedback

- Bug: `store.values` becomes stale after the first `setValue` because `values` is reassigned to a new object without updating the exposed `store.values` reference. Any consumer reading `store.values` (e.g., via `useStore`) will never see updates. Fix by storing `values` on the store object and mutating/assigning through that, or add a getter for `values` instead of a fixed field. File: `src/workflow/create-workflow.tsx`.
