**Commit Message:** 📝 docs: replace state management page with React docs link

Remove custom state management documentation in favor of linking to React's official state management guide (https://react.dev/learn/managing-state). This avoids duplication and ensures users get the most up-to-date React documentation.

Changes:
- Deleted docs/concepts/state-management.mdx
- Removed state-management from Core Concepts sidebar in mint.json
- Updated ralph-wiggum-loop.mdx to link to React docs

### Summary

The commit aims to simplify documentation by removing a custom state management guide in favor of linking to the official React documentation. While the removal of the file and the update to the navigation configuration (`mint.json`) are correct, the change is incomplete and potentially removes critical information.

### Issues Found

1.  **Incomplete Change:** The commit message states, "Updated ralph-wiggum-loop.mdx to link to React docs," but the diff does not include any changes for this file. The promised update is missing.

2.  **Removal of Essential Documentation:** The deleted file, `docs/concepts/state-management.mdx`, contained documentation for two separate concepts:
    *   React's `useState` (which is fine to remove).
    *   The project-specific database persistence API (`db.state`).

    By deleting the entire file, the documentation for the custom database persistence layer (`db.state.set`, `db.state.get`, `db.state.history`, etc.) has been removed without a replacement. This is critical information for developers using the platform that is not covered by the React documentation.

### Suggested Improvements

1.  **Complete the Change:** Update `docs/concepts/ralph-wiggum-loop.mdx` (or another appropriate file) to include the link to the React state management documentation (`https://react.dev/learn/managing-state`) as described in the commit message.
2.  **Retain Database Documentation:** Do not delete the documentation for the `db.state` API. This information should be moved from the old `state-management.mdx` file into `docs/concepts/database-persistence.mdx` to ensure the project's custom API remains documented.
