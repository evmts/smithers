**Commit Message:** test commit

### Summary

This commit systematically updates numerous review documents (`reviews/*.md`) by adding structured `Status` and `Debugging Plan` sections. This is a highly valuable change that makes the reviews significantly more actionable and easier to track. The plans are thorough, providing clear steps, code snippets, and commands to help developers address the identified issues.

However, there is one minor inconsistency in one of the updated review files.

### Specific Issues Found

- **File**: `reviews/20260118_180952_d622b66.md`
- **Issue**: In the "Debugging Plan" section, the "Additional Fix" subsection contains a contradiction. The text instructs the reader to "Add ` @deprecated` JSDoc tag to the `Ralph` function," but the following code example does not contain a `@deprecated` tag. Instead, it shows a custom `@reference/...` tag, which seems to be a copy-paste error.

  **Incorrect Code Example:**
  ```tsx
  /**
   * @reference/vercel-ai-sdk/packages/codemod/src/test/remove-deprecated-provider-registry-exports.test.ts Use SmithersProvider directly with db.tasks for task tracking
   */
  export function Ralph(props: RalphProps): ReactNode {
  ```

### Suggested Improvements

Correct the code example in `reviews/20260118_180952_d622b66.md` to align with the instruction of adding a `@deprecated` tag.

**Suggested Correction:**
```tsx
/**
 * @deprecated Use SmithersProvider directly.
 */
export function Ralph(props: RalphProps): ReactNode {
```

## Status: RESOLVED

The issue has been fixed. Checking `reviews/20260118_180952_d622b66.md` lines 102-107 shows correct `@deprecated` JSDoc syntax, not the `@reference/...` tag mentioned. Additionally, `src/components/Ralph.tsx` line 92 already has the proper `@deprecated` tag on the function. The copy-paste error mentioned in this review has been corrected.
