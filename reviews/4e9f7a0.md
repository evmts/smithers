# Review: 4e9f7a0

**Commit:** 4e9f7a08d95627d1f6559f36e01bfc46242d5d94
**Message:** docs: use Zustand for state management examples
**Date:** 2026-01-05 21:44:03 UTC

## Feedback

- README.md: The Zustand stores are module-level singletons, so multiple `ResearchAgent` instances (or remounts with a new topic) will share state and leak `sources/analyses/findings` across agents; consider moving store creation into a factory or passing a `createStore` per agent instance.  
- README.md: `setSources` doesn’t clear `analyses`, so new searches can instantly flip to `write` based on stale analyses; reset `analyses` (and maybe `phase`) when starting a new research run.
