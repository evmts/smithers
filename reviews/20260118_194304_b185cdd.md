---

This is a massive and valuable commit that adds a tremendous amount of test coverage across the entire project, replacing many placeholder `test.todo` items with concrete implementations. This is a very significant improvement to the project's stability and maintainability.

However, the commit message is misleading as it only mentions tests for the `Parallel` component, while the changes are far more extensive. Additionally, an unrelated code review file has been included.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Inaccurate Commit Message**: The commit message is "Add comprehensive tests for Parallel component". However, the changes add tests for dozens of components, hooks, and utilities across the entire codebase, including the database layer, commands, TUI, and reconciler. The message does not reflect the broad and impactful scope of these changes.

2.  **Irrelevant Review File**: The commit adds a new file `reviews/20260118_193632_b98ce89.md`. This file appears to be a code review for a different commit (`b98ce89`) and its content is not related to the changes in the current commit (`b185cdd`).

### Suggested Improvements

1.  **Update Commit Message**: The commit message should be updated to accurately describe the full scope of the changes. A more fitting message would be something like: "feat(test): Add comprehensive tests across all modules" or "test: Implement tests for core components, hooks, and commands".

2.  **Remove Irrelevant File**: The file `reviews/20260118_193632_b98ce89.md` should be removed from this commit to keep the changeset focused and clean.
