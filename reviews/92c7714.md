**Message:** 🧪 test(workflow): add workflow system tests

## Feedback

- `evals/workflow.test.tsx`: The "reactive re-execution" test doesn't actually change `iteration` or assert re-execution; it only checks `executionCount >= 1`. This can pass even if reactive re-run is broken. Add a state update that increments `iteration` (e.g., via workflow output or store) and assert `executionCount` increases across frames.
