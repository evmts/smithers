**Message:** ✨ feat(types): add ProviderContext and update HumanPrompt types
**Date:** 2026-01-06 07:12:27 UTC

## Feedback

- `src/core/execute.ts:239`: With the new `onHumanPrompt` union type, a consumer can provide the enhanced `(info: HumanPromptInfo)` signature, but the runtime only passes `HumanPromptInfo` when `hasWorkflowOutputs` is true. For Human prompts without outputs, it passes `(message, content)` strings, which will break enhanced-only callbacks at runtime. Consider always calling the enhanced shape (with `outputs: []`) and adapting legacy callbacks, or explicitly document/gate the enhanced signature to outputs-only and enforce it in types.
