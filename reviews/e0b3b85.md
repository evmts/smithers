**Message:** 🐛 fix: use stable node paths for execution state tracking
**Date:** 2026-01-05 23:39:46 UTC

## Feedback

- `src/core/execute.ts`: `restoreExecutionState` now requires `savedState.contentHash === currentHash`, but `saveExecutionState` doesn’t ensure `node._execution.contentHash` is set. Any legacy/partial `_execution` (or restored state without `contentHash`) will never restore. Fix by setting `node._execution.contentHash = computeContentHash(node)` before `storage.set`, or allow restore when `contentHash` is missing.
