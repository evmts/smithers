**Commit:** d3913f64dd19ebca7ce704974e8bed6811aa5e6b
**Message:** ✨ feat: add <Human> component for interactive approval points
**Date:** 2026-01-06 00:29:51 UTC

## Feedback

- `src/core/execute.ts:119`: If `onHumanPrompt` is provided and returns `true` but the `<Human>` node has no `onApprove`, the node stays in the tree and `onHumanPrompt` will be called every frame, causing an infinite prompt loop. Track approval per Human node (e.g., in `executionState`) or auto-skip once approved when no callback/state change occurs, and add a test for this case.
