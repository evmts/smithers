## Feedback

- Doc inconsistency about execution order: `docs/components/subagent.mdx` says “first sequential <Claude> node” then “all <Subagent> nodes in parallel,” but the visualization comments claim subagents run with Sequential 1. Clarify whether subagents run concurrently with the first sequential Claude or only after it finishes, and update the bullet list + comments to match.
- Ambiguous sequencing for multiple sequential Claude nodes: `docs/components/subagent.mdx` implies only the “first sequential” runs before subagents, but the visualization shows two sequential nodes. Clarify the actual ordering and whether Sequential 2 waits for subagents or not.
