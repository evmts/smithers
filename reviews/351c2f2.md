# Review: 351c2f2

**Commit:** 351c2f29d52a23c20833a5cb150ad01630b5a3be
**Message:** docs: update important-memories with 2026-01-06 session status
**Date:** 2026-01-07 05:35:46 UTC

## Feedback

The new status section says “707 passing, 2 skip, 20 fail,” which conflicts with the commit message/earlier claim of “Verified production readiness (707 tests passing…)”. Clarify the test status: either update the summary claims or explain why 20 failing tests are acceptable and still “production-ready” to avoid misleading documentation.
