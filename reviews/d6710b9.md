## Feedback

- `examples/04-parallel-research/agent.tsx:210-229`: topics never transition to `in_progress`, so `pendingTopics` never shrinks and each render can recreate the same `<Subagent>` and rerun research. Mark topics as `in_progress` when launching, and filter by `pending`/`in_progress` accordingly.
- `examples/04-parallel-research/agent.tsx:215-217`: calling `useStore.getState().nextPhase()` during render triggers a state update in render; move this to an effect or trigger phase changes only from completion callbacks.
