## Feedback

- docs/tui-research.md:1616: `useState` is still imported but no longer used; update the import to `{ useEffect, useRef }` to avoid lint errors in the example.
- docs/tui-research.md:1622: `renderer` is captured in the effect but omitted from the dependency array; include it (and keep the interval cleanup) to avoid stale renderer references if the hook ever changes.
