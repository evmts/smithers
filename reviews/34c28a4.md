# Review: 34c28a4

**Commit:** 34c28a4af07d1edeef23697119adbcc6ce7145de
**Message:** fix(tui): only show status badges for executable nodes
**Date:** 2026-01-07 05:37:07 UTC

## Feedback

Mismatch between code and comments: `EXECUTABLE_NODE_TYPES` includes `ROOT`, but the JSDoc says only claude/claude-api/human. Either add ROOT to the comment (and explain why it has status) or remove ROOT from the set. This affects whether root nodes show `[pending]`, which may be unintended.
