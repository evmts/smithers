# Code Review for Commit ca04254

**Date:** 2026-01-18 19:09:10
**Commit Message:** test commit

---

### Summary

This commit updates several review documents by adding status checks and debugging plans. While most of these additions are detailed and actionable, the commit is flawed by the inclusion of a new, out-of-context review file that references changes not present in this commit. There is also a minor date typo in one of the files.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Irrelevant Review File Added**: A new file, `reviews/20260118_190424_df49d8b.md`, is added to the commit. This file appears to be a review for a completely different commit (`df49d8b`) and mentions issues in files that are not part of this changeset (e.g., `reviews/limited-error-context.md`, `reviews/mcp-only-sqlite.md`). Its inclusion is confusing and adds noise.

2.  **Date Typo**: In `reviews/pr-9-jsx-runtime-bypasses-react.md`, the date for the "Status Check" is listed as `2025-01-18`. Given the current date and the dates in other updated files, this is likely a typo and should be `2026-01-18`.
    - **File**: `reviews/pr-9-jsx-runtime-bypasses-react.md`
    - **Line**: 150 (`## Status Check: 2025-01-18`)

### Suggested Improvements

1.  **Remove Irrelevant File**: The file `reviews/20260118_190424_df49d8b.md` should be removed from this commit to avoid confusion. It does not pertain to the other changes being made.
2.  **Correct Date Typo**: Fix the year in `reviews/pr-9-jsx-runtime-bypasses-react.md` from `2025` to `2026` to maintain consistency and accuracy across the review documents.
