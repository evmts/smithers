# Review: e6afc17

**Commit:** e6afc17b2d03939830edb7ee270b0e5ab14b2ed8
**Message:** docs: verify production readiness at 00:19 - all systems green
**Date:** 2026-01-08 08:20:05 UTC

## Feedback

In `bash/important-memories.md`, the verification section is internally inconsistent: it says “663/665 passing (2 skipped)” but later claims “All 665 tests passing.” Clarify whether 2 tests are skipped or all pass, and keep the counts consistent.
