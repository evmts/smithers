**Date:** 2026-01-18 18:18:30
**Commit Message:** 📝 docs: add VCS operation queue design issue

Documents FIFO queue mechanism to prevent race conditions in git/jj operations:
- Git: batch commits at render boundaries
- JJ: real-time snapshots via serialized queue

Also fixes TypeScript error in executor.ts (process.env index signature)

### Summary

This is a large and mixed commit that primarily refactors the core orchestration component (`<Orchestration>` into `<SmithersProvider>`), introduces a new `<If>` component for cleaner conditional rendering, adds complex retry logic for the Claude agent, and includes a massive amount of new documentation for planned features and expanded issue designs.

While many of the individual changes are positive improvements (especially the component refactoring and new documentation), the commit has several major issues. The most critical is that the commit message is completely inaccurate, making it impossible to understand the commit's purpose. Additionally, there is significant duplicated code, fragile logic, and an undocumented removal of a CLI flag.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Critical: Inaccurate Commit Message**
    The commit message is `📝 docs: add VCS operation queue design issue`. This does not describe the contents of the commit. This commit performs a major refactoring of core components, adds new features, and contains dozens of file changes unrelated to a "VCS operation queue design issue". This commit should be broken down into several smaller, atomic commits with accurate messages.

2.  **Maintenance: Duplicated Code**
    -   **File**: `scripts/worktree.ts`
    -   **Issue**: The complex logic for retrying a Claude CLI command with an API key upon subscription failure is duplicated almost identically in two functions: `deployToWorktree` and `runWorktreeAgent`. This large block of code (~50 lines) is difficult to maintain.
    -   **Suggestion**: This logic should be extracted into a single, reusable helper function to avoid code duplication and simplify future maintenance.

3.  **Bug Risk: Fragile Agent Detection**
    -   **File**: `scripts/worktree.ts`
    -   **Issue**: The logic to differentiate between `claude` and `codex` agents relies on string-matching model names (`config.agent.startsWith('o1') || config.agent.startsWith('o3')`). This is brittle and will break if model names change or new providers are added.
    -   **Suggestion**: A more robust solution, like an explicit `provider` field in the configuration, should be considered to make the agent selection logic less prone to errors.

4.  **Undocumented Change: Removal of CLI Flag**
    -   **File**: `scripts/worktree.ts`
    -   **Issue**: The `--thinking` argument for the Claude CLI is removed in two places without explanation in the commit message. It is unclear if this flag is deprecated or if its removal was accidental.
    -   **Suggestion**: If this change is intentional, it should be documented. If it is a mistake, it should be restored.

5.  **Massive Commit Scope**
    -   **Issue**: This commit is far too large and mixes concerns. It includes a major refactoring, new features, bug fixes, documentation, and design planning. Such large commits are difficult to review, revert, and understand.
    -   **Suggestion**: The changes should be split into logical, atomic commits. For example:
        *   `refactor: Move Orchestration props to SmithersProvider`
        *   `feat: Add <If> component for conditional rendering`
        *   `feat(claude): Add automatic retry with API key on auth failure`
        *   `docs: Add design documents for planned components (Codex, Gemini, etc.)`
        *   `docs: Expand design for control flow and plan marker issues`

### Suggested Improvements

-   **Reject this commit.** It should be broken down into multiple, smaller commits with accurate and descriptive messages.
-   **Refactor `scripts/worktree.ts`** to extract the duplicated retry logic into a shared helper function.
-   **Improve agent detection** to be more robust than string matching on model names.
-   **Clarify the removal** of the `--thinking` flag.
