**Message:** feat: implement CLI with stubs for React rendering

## Feedback

- `src/cli/commands/run.ts:20` declares `--watch` but there is no watch logic; either implement file watching or remove the option to avoid a misleading CLI.
- `src/cli/commands/run.ts:92` and `src/cli/commands/run.ts:96` parse `--max-frames`/`--timeout` without validation; `parseInt` can yield `NaN`, which will propagate into execution. Add numeric validation and a clear error message.
- `src/cli/commands/plan.ts:38` and `src/cli/commands/run.ts:47` only check existence; if the path is a directory the CLI will proceed and fail later. Add a file-type check (`stat.isFile()`).
- `src/cli/prompt.ts:52` `editPlan()` is surfaced in the approval loop but is a no-op; users can select edit and get no change. Either disable the option until implemented or re-render with the edited plan.
