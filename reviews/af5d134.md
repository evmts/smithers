## Feedback

- `bash/ralph.sh`: `set -e` will terminate the script on the first non‑zero exit from `claude`, so the “continuous loop” stops on any failure. If you intend to keep looping, wrap the `claude` call to capture the exit code without `set -e` aborting (e.g., `set +e; claude ...; EXIT_CODE=$?; set -e`) and decide whether to continue or break based on `EXIT_CODE`.
