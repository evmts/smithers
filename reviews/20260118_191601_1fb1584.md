**Commit Message:** test(monitor): add comprehensive test.todo() entries for missing test coverage

- stream-formatter: 38 missing tests for edge cases (header, events, stats, summary)
- log-writer: 54 missing tests for file system errors, streams, concurrent writes
- output-parser: 57 missing tests for malformed input, parsing edge cases, encoding
- haiku-summarizer: 49 missing tests (new file, had 0 tests before)

Total: 198 test.todo() entries added

---

A brief summary of the changes:
This commit introduces a significant number of `test.todo()` entries across four test files related to the `monitor` module: `haiku-summarizer.test.ts` (new file), `log-writer.test.ts`, `output-parser.test.ts`, and `stream-formatter.test.ts`. The purpose is to document missing test coverage for various edge cases, API interactions, error handling, and performance concerns, totaling 198 new test placeholders.

Overall, this is a positive and valuable change, as it clearly outlines areas where testing needs to be improved. The descriptions for the `test.todo()` entries are generally clear and comprehensive, providing a good roadmap for future test implementation.

LGTM.
