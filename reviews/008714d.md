**Message:** 🐛 fix: remove empty tools object from MCP client capabilities
**Date:** 2026-01-05 23:29:07 UTC

## Feedback

Potential issue:
- `src/mcp/manager.ts`: `capabilities` is now always `{}`. If this client does support tools, removing `capabilities.tools` will stop advertising tool support and could disable tool-related flows on compatible servers. Action: set `capabilities.tools` only when tool support exists (e.g., conditionally include it when you actually provide tools), rather than removing it unconditionally.
