**Commit Message:** Fix: Document schemaRetries prop in Claude component docs

---

### Summary

The commit's message, "Fix: Document schemaRetries prop in Claude component docs," does not match the provided code changes. The commit introduces a mix of unrelated changes, including new placeholder files, a generated review file, and minor code modifications, which makes the repository history confusing and difficult to track.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Misleading Commit Message**: The commit message is completely disconnected from the actual changes. The diff does not contain any modifications to documentation or a `Claude` component. This undermines the integrity of the version history.

2.  **Committing Generated Artifacts**:
    *   **File**: `reviews/20260118_210421_fff68d1.md`
    *   **Issue**: This file appears to be a generated code review. Committing such artifacts adds noise to the repository and should generally be avoided. The `reviews/` directory should likely be added to `.gitignore`.

3.  **Placeholder Content**:
    *   **File**: `issues/e2e.md`
    *   **Issue**: This new file contains only placeholder content ("e2e"). Files should be added with meaningful content, even if it's just an initial description of the issue.

4.  **Redundant Code Changes**:
    *   **File**: `src/utils/capture.ts`
    *   **Lines**: 21-25
    *   **Issue**: The change from `property?: T` to `property?: T | undefined` is redundant. In TypeScript, optional properties are already of type `T | undefined`, so this adds unnecessary verbosity without changing the behavior.

5.  **Potentially Unsafe Non-Null Assertion**:
    *   **File**: `scripts/export-codebase.ts`
    *   **Line**: 200
    *   **Issue**: Using a non-null assertion (`!`) on `SECTIONS[sectionName]` bypasses TypeScript's type safety. If `sectionName` is ever a value not present in `SECTIONS`, this will result in a runtime error. It would be safer to perform an explicit check.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Correct the commit message** to accurately reflect the changes made.
*   **Split unrelated changes into separate, atomic commits**. For example, one commit for the new issue file and another for the code tweaks.
*   **Avoid committing generated files.** Add the `reviews/` directory to your `.gitignore` file.
*   **Remove the redundant `| undefined`** from the types in `src/utils/capture.ts` to keep the code clean.
*   **Replace the non-null assertion with a proper check** in `scripts/export-codebase.ts` to handle cases where a section might not be found and prevent potential runtime errors. For example:
    ```typescript
    const config = SECTIONS[sectionName];
    if (!config) {
      console.error(`Error: Section '${sectionName}' not found.`);
      process.exit(1);
    }
    ```
