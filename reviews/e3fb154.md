# Review: e3fb154

**Commit:** e3fb1544ea34714d621dd3a460fb0206e861143a
**Message:** docs: Add comprehensive session summary for production verification
**Date:** 2026-01-08 03:47:19 UTC

## Feedback

The new session summary claims `bash/important-memories.md` was updated, but this commit only adds `bash/session-2026-01-07-1942.md`. Either include the missing file in the commit or adjust the summary text in `bash/session-2026-01-07-1942.md` to match the actual changes.
