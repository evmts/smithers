**Commit Message:** Fix: Step.tsx add onError callback prop

---

### Summary

This commit is problematic for two main reasons. First, the commit message is entirely disconnected from the actual changes, which makes the repository history misleading. Second, the change itself involves committing a generated artifact (a code review file), which is a practice that clutters the repository and should be avoided.

### Issues

1.  **Mismatched Commit Message and Changes**:
    -   **Commit Message**: `Fix: Step.tsx add onError callback prop`
    -   **Actual Changes**: The diff only shows the addition of a new file, `reviews/20260118_210018_50c5cef.md`. There are no changes related to `Step.tsx` or any `onError` prop. This discrepancy makes the commit history inaccurate and difficult to understand.

2.  **Committing Generated Artifacts**:
    -   **File**: `reviews/20260118_210018_50c5cef.md`
    -   **Issue**: The file being added is a machine-generated code review. Committing such artifacts is not a good practice as they are not source code and add noise to the version control history. Ironically, the content of the added file itself correctly criticizes this very practice.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Do Not Commit Generated Files**: Generated content like code reviews should not be checked into the source repository. Consider adding the `reviews/` directory to your `.gitignore` file to prevent this from happening in the future.
*   **Create Accurate Commits**: Commits should be atomic and have descriptive messages that accurately reflect their changes. The intended fix for `Step.tsx` should be in a separate commit with the appropriate message, and the addition of this review file should be reverted.
