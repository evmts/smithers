# Review: mount hides orchestration errors

sev: high
file: src/reconciler/root.ts:129-131

issue: completionPromise rejection swallowed; only fatalError throws.
flow: signalError -> completionPromise.reject -> catch() -> Promise.race resolves -> no throw.

risk: orchestration failures silently pass; callers think success.
fix: drop catch or rethrow; include rejection in race; add test for signalOrchestrationErrorByToken.
