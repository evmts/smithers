# Code Review for Commit 73a0793

**Commit Message:** Add failing reactive-sqlite tests to TODO.md

---

I will list the contents of the `src/reactive-sqlite/hooks/` directory to confirm the existence of the test file mentioned in the `TODO.md` update.
I will read the first few lines of `src/reactive-sqlite/hooks/context.test.tsx` to confirm if it uses React hooks or DOM APIs, which would explain the failures described in the `TODO.md` update.
LGTM
