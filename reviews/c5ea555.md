**Message:** 🐛 fix: correct MCP SDK import paths with .js extensions
**Date:** 2026-01-05 23:26:31 UTC

## Feedback

The new specifiers may break package exports. `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` likely exposes subpaths like `./client` and `./client/stdio` (without `.js`) via its `exports` map; importing `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js` or `.../stdio.js` can be rejected by Node ESM if those exact keys aren’t exported. Action: verify the SDK’s `package.json` `exports`; if it doesn’t include the `.js`-suffixed keys, revert to the exported subpaths and fix resolution via TS/Node settings (e.g., `moduleResolution: "node16"`/`"bundler"`), or update the SDK if it now expects `.js` keys.
