# Review: 03975a3

**Commit:** 03975a31e53fb2f3a5259147d7e1c85db61b09be
**Message:** docs: add comprehensive release checklist
**Date:** 2026-01-07 03:48:16 UTC

## Feedback

In `bash/important-memories.md`, the new “Ready for release” bullets now conflict with the existing note a few lines later: “Currently 707 tests passing, 2 skip, 20 failures…”. Please reconcile these statements (either update the remaining-test-issues line or adjust the release-ready claim) to avoid contradictory documentation.
