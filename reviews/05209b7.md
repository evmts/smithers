**Commit:** 05209b78b0b95285c262874a8c7229ef79fe1bc1
**Message:** docs: Add session summary for documentation consistency fixes
**Date:** 2026-01-08 03:38:10 UTC

## Feedback

The new session summary claims it fixed inconsistencies in `bash/session-2026-01-07-1928.md`, `bash/session-2026-01-07-1930.md`, and deleted `reviews/9735bcb.md`, but none of those changes are in this commit. Please either include those file edits/deletion in this commit or update `bash/session-2026-01-07-1934.md` to accurately reflect only the changes made here.
