### Summary

This commit introduces a helpful documentation clarification and adds a significant and powerful new set of orchestration control features to `SmithersProvider` (e.g., global timeouts, stop conditions, VCS snapshots).

However, the commit message is inaccurate and misleading, and the change introduces a new, unused type interface.

### Specific Issues

1.  **Misleading Commit Message:** The commit message states, "Removed unused OrchestrationResult variable in SmithersProvider". This is incorrect. The provided diff shows the `OrchestrationResult` **type interface** being **added**, not a variable being removed. The message also completely omits the main change, which is the addition of major orchestration control features. This makes it difficult to understand the purpose and scope of the commit from its description.

2.  **Unused Code (`OrchestrationResult`)**:
    -   **File:** `src/components/SmithersProvider.tsx`
    -   **Line:** 79-87
    -   **Issue:** The `OrchestrationResult` interface is added but is not used anywhere. The comment on line 629 (`// Note: Could generate OrchestrationResult here...`) confirms it is intended for future use. Unused code should not be added to the codebase, as it can cause confusion.

3.  **Hardcoded Check Interval**:
    -   **File:** `src/components/SmithersProvider.tsx`
    -   **Line:** 506
    -   **Issue:** The `setInterval` for checking stop conditions is hardcoded to `1000`ms. For long-running tasks, this might be too frequent, causing unnecessary overhead. For rapid tasks, it might be too slow. This value should be configurable.

### Suggested Improvements

-   **Correct the Commit Message:** The commit message should be rewritten to accurately reflect the changes. For example:
    ```
    feat(orchestration): Add global controls to SmithersProvider

    - Adds global timeout, stop conditions, and pre-run snapshotting
      capabilities to the SmithersProvider.
    - Updates documentation to include examples of the new features.

    docs: Clarify default database location

    - Adds a comment to the persistence docs recommending
      .smithers/my-workflow as the default path for workflow databases.
    ```
-   **Remove Unused Code:** Remove the `OrchestrationResult` interface from `src/components/SmithersProvider.tsx`. It can be re-added when the feature that uses it is implemented.
-   **Make Interval Configurable:** Add a new prop to `SmithersProviderProps`, such as `checkIntervalMs`, to allow consumers to configure the frequency of the stop condition checks. Default it to a reasonable value if not provided.
