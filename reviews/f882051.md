## Feedback

Two consistency issues in the doc update:
- `bash/important-memories.md`: “Core functionality: 665 tests (663 passing, 2 skipped, 0 failing)” conflicts with the earlier “663/665 passing (2 skipped)”. If 2 are skipped, passing count should be 663 with total 665; consider rephrasing as “665 total: 663 passing, 2 skipped.”
- `bash/important-memories.md`: “Git: Clean working tree, all commits pushed” conflicts with “Git status: Only bash/important-memories.md modified (this file)”. Make these consistent (e.g., remove the “clean” line or clarify timing).
