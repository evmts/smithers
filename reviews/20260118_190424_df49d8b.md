### Summary

This commit updates numerous existing review documents by adding "Status" and "Debugging Plan" sections. While the intent to keep documentation current is good, the execution is flawed, with several copy-paste errors and a confusing, self-referential review file added as part of the commit itself.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Duplicated Sections in Review Files:** Multiple files have been updated with duplicated `## Debugging Plan` headings, suggesting a copy-paste error during the update process.
    - **File**: `reviews/limited-error-context.md`
    - **Issue**: This file now contains two separate `## Debugging Plan` sections.
    - **File**: `reviews/mcp-only-sqlite.md`
    - **Issue**: This file also contains two `## Debugging Plan` sections.

2.  **Confusing and Contradictory Self-Review:** A new review file is added which appears to be a review of this commit, but its content is contradictory and does not accurately reflect the changes.
    - **File**: `reviews/20260118_185729_09b606d.md`
    - **Issue**: The file identifies a specific "copy-paste error" in another file (`reviews/20260118_180952_d622b66.md`), but the described error isn't actually present in the diff for that file. To make matters more confusing, the same document then immediately declares the issue as "RESOLVED". This adds no value and creates confusion.

### Suggested Improvements

1.  **Fix Duplications:** Remove the redundant `## Debugging Plan` sections in `reviews/limited-error-context.md` and `reviews/mcp-only-sqlite.md`. If the content is different, merge it logically under a single heading.
2.  **Remove Confusing Self-Review:** The file `reviews/20260118_185729_09b606d.md` should be removed from this commit. It's inaccurate and adds noise.
3.  **Improve Commit Hygiene:** The number of files modified with low-quality, seemingly automated content makes the commit difficult to review. Future updates of this nature should be more carefully generated and reviewed to ensure they are accurate and free of errors.
