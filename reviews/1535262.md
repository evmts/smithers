## Feedback

- `src/core/claude-executor.ts`: The legacy `parameters` format (per README/previous usage) often encodes required fields per property (e.g., `required: true`). This conversion hard-codes `required: []`, so required fields are silently dropped. Suggest deriving `required` from legacy property flags (and stripping them) or detect when `parameters` is already a full JSON Schema vs. properties and map accordingly.
