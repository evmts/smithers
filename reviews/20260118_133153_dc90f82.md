# Code Review for Commit dc90f82

**Date:** 2026-01-18 13:31:53
**Commit Message:** test commit

---

### Summary

This commit is a significant housekeeping and enhancement effort for the project's issue and review documentation stored in the `reviews/` directory. It deletes reports for issues that appear to be resolved and substantially enriches the reports for open issues with detailed analysis, implementation plans, file paths, and scope tags (e.g., `easy`, `major`). These changes make the outstanding issues much more actionable. The commit also adds new review files, including a highly detailed self-review template, which is a valuable process improvement.

The content of the changes is excellent, but the commit message is a major issue.

### Issues Found

*   **Commit Message:** The commit message is `test commit`. This is highly uninformative and does not in any way describe the significant and valuable documentation changes being made. The changes involve adding, deleting, and modifying over a dozen files in a meaningful way; the commit message should reflect this. Ironically, one of the newly added review files (`reviews/20260118_132246_161937b.md`) correctly criticizes another commit for having a message that doesn't match its content, a problem this commit shares.

### Suggested Improvements

The commit should be amended with a descriptive and conventional commit message that accurately reflects the work done.

**Recommendation:**

Rebase and amend the commit message to something like the following:

```
docs(reviews): clean up and enhance issue reports

This commit overhauls the issue reports located in the `reviews/` directory to improve clarity, accuracy, and actionability.

- Deletes reports for resolved issues, including `integration-tests-disabled`, `jsx-runtime-bypasses-react`, and `ralph-loop-undocumented`.
- Enriches reports for open issues (`control-flow`, `database-migrations`, `limited-error-context`, etc.) with detailed implementation plans, file paths, code patterns, and scope estimates.
- Adds new review documents and a comprehensive self-review template to improve the code review process.
```
