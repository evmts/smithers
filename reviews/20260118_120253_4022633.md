# Code Review for Commit 4022633

**Commit Message:** fix(reconciler): correct createContainer signature to 10 params

@types/react-reconciler 0.32 declares 8 params but react-reconciler
0.33.0 runtime expects 10. Previous 8-param call misaligned handlers:
- "recoverable error" was bound to onUncaughtError slot
- onCaughtError was null
- onRecoverableError was undefined (crashes on error paths)

Now passes all 10 params with proper error handler separation.

### Summary

The commit correctly fixes a critical signature mismatch in the `SmithersReconciler.createContainer` call, aligning it with the runtime's expected 10 parameters. This is a crucial bug fix that properly wires up error handlers.

However, the commit is not atomic as it bundles this unrelated bug fix with the addition of a code review for a completely different commit.

### Issues Found

#### 1. Commit Mixes Unrelated Changes

*   **Issue:** The commit bundles two distinct logical changes:
    1.  A bug fix for the reconciler (`src/reconciler/root.ts`).
    2.  The addition of a new code review file (`reviews/20260118_120016_c00fc94.md`) that pertains to a different commit (`c00fc94`) about documentation.
*   **Impact:** This violates the principle of atomic commits, where each commit should represent a single logical change. It makes the git history harder to read, search, and manage.
*   **File:** Applies to the commit structure itself.

#### 2. Incomplete Commit Message

*   **Issue:** The commit message `fix(reconciler): correct createContainer signature to 10 params` accurately describes the change to `src/reconciler/root.ts` but completely omits any mention of the newly added review file.
*   **Impact:** A developer reading the git log would be unaware that this commit also adds a code review, making the history less transparent.

### Suggested Improvements

#### Split into Atomic Commits

To improve the project's history, this work should be split into two separate, focused commits. This can be achieved using `git rebase -i` or by resetting and re-committing.

*   **Commit 1: `fix(reconciler): correct createContainer signature to 10 params`**
    *   This commit should only contain the changes to `src/reconciler/root.ts`.
    ```
    MODIFIED src/reconciler/root.ts
    ```

*   **Commit 2: `docs(review): add review for commit c00fc94`**
    *   This commit should only contain the new review file.
    ```
    ADDED reviews/20260118_120016_c00fc94.md
    ```

This separation will create a clean, readable, and maintainable git history. No functional bugs were found in the code changes themselves; the issue is purely structural.
