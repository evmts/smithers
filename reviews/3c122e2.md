# Review: 3c122e2

**Commit:** 3c122e241d21824d0e718423512d25de8305793d
**Message:** chore: Add Session 2026-01-07 Evening Final Production Audit to memories
**Date:** 2026-01-07 18:11:38 UTC

## Feedback

The new memory entry is internally inconsistent: it reports “20 fail (all SolidJS)” in the test suite, then later states “Tests: 663 Smithers pass, 0 fail” and concludes “PRODUCTION-READY.” Please reconcile the failure count and update the readiness conclusion (or explicitly scope “0 fail” to Smithers-only) to avoid misleading audit records.
