# Code Review for Commit 9c06ac9

**Date:** 2026-01-18 21:09:17
**Commit Message:** chore: Remove processed review files

---

### Summary

The commit's message, "chore: Remove processed review files," is misleading. The commit removes one document outlining test coverage gaps but also adds a new file containing a code review of a completely different, earlier commit. These two actions are unrelated, and bundling them together in a single commit with an inaccurate message makes the project history confusing.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Inaccurate Commit Message**: The message implies a simple cleanup or removal of multiple files. However, the commit actually swaps one file for another, which is not reflected in the message.
2.  **Lack of Atomicity**: The commit mixes two unrelated concerns, violating the principle of single-responsibility for commits.
    *   **Change 1**: Deletion of `reviews/test-coverage-reconciler-hooks.md`, a document analyzing test coverage.
    *   **Change 2**: Addition of `reviews/20260118_210844_af63df2.md`, a code review for a past commit (`af63df2`).
    There is no clear connection between removing a test strategy document and adding a specific code review artifact.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Split the Commit**: The changes should be separated into two atomic commits, each with a clear and descriptive message.
    1.  **Commit 1 (File Deletion):**
        *   **Suggested Message**: `docs: Remove test coverage analysis for reconciler hooks`
        *   **Action**: This commit should only contain the deletion of `reviews/test-coverage-reconciler-hooks.md`. It would be helpful to include context in the commit body explaining why it's being removed (e.g., it's obsolete, the work is complete, etc.).
    2.  **Commit 2 (File Addition):**
        *   **Suggested Message**: `docs: Add code review for commit af63df2`
        *   **Action**: This commit should only contain the addition of `reviews/20260118_210844_af63df2.md`.
*   **Improve Review Workflow**: If storing code reviews as markdown files in the repository is part of the development process, consider standardizing the commit messages and ensuring they accurately reflect the content being added or managed.
