**Message:** 📝 docs: add Claude component documentation

## Feedback

docs/components/subagent.mdx:~112–144 — The “Execution Flow” text says the first sequential `<Claude>` runs before subagents, but the visualization claims subagents run with “Sequential 1.” These are contradictory. Clarify whether subagents run after all sequential Claude nodes or concurrently with the first one, and update the diagram or text to match.
