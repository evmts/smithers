**Commit Message:** Fix: git notes flag interpolation bug - use args array

---

### Summary

This commit is problematic for two main reasons. First, its commit message, "Fix: git notes flag interpolation bug - use args array," is entirely disconnected from the actual changes, which consist of adding a new markdown review file. Second, this commit continues the practice of adding transient review artifacts to the repository, which clutters the project's history. Ironically, the content of the newly added review file itself criticizes this very practice.

### Issues

1.  **Incorrect and Misleading Commit Message**:
    -   The commit message describes a bug fix related to `git notes`. However, the diff shows no code changes related to such a fix. The only change is the addition of the file `reviews/20260118_210119_1318c51.md`. This makes the commit history confusing and unreliable.

2.  **Committing Transient Artifacts**:
    -   **File**: `reviews/20260118_210119_1318c51.md`
    -   **Issue**: This commit adds another review file to the `reviews/` directory. Committing generated or temporary review notes adds noise to the repository and makes the history difficult to navigate. This action contradicts the advice within the file itself, which recommends against storing these artifacts in version control.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Revert or Amend the Commit**: This commit should be reverted or amended. The commit message must be corrected to reflect the actual changes, and more importantly, the practice of committing review files should be stopped.
*   **Update `.gitignore`**: The `reviews/` directory should be added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent these transient files from being committed in the future.
*   **Create a Proper Commit for the Bug Fix**: The bug fix described in the commit message should be implemented and committed separately with the correct code changes and a matching message.
