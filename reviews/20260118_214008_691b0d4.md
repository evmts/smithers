**Commit Message:** Fix: Document schemaRetries prop in Claude component docs

---

### Summary

The commit is problematic due to a completely misleading commit message that does not reflect the changes made. The commit message states the change is to "Document schemaRetries prop in Claude component docs", but none of the changes are related to documentation or the Claude component. Instead, the commit bundles several unrelated changes, including adding an issue file, a generated review artifact, and minor code modifications. This makes the commit history difficult to understand and navigate.

### Specific Issues Found

1.  **Misleading Commit Message**: The commit message is "Fix: Document schemaRetries prop in Claude component docs". However, none of the changes in the diff are related to this. The changes are scattered across different parts of the codebase and have no apparent connection to the stated purpose.

2.  **Bundling Unrelated Changes**: The commit combines multiple distinct changes that should be in separate, atomic commits with accurate messages:
    *   **Docs**: Adding a new issue file (`issues/e2e.md`).
    *   **Typing**: Updating type definitions to explicitly include `undefined` in `src/utils/capture.ts`.
    *   **Refactor**: Adding a non-null assertion operator in `scripts/export-codebase.ts`.
    *   **Artifact**: Adding a generated code review file (`reviews/20260118_210421_fff68d1.md`).

3.  **Committing Generated Artifacts**:
    *   **File**: `reviews/20260118_210421_fff68d1.md`
    *   **Issue**: This new file appears to be a generated code review artifact. Committing generated files adds noise to the repository and is generally discouraged. The `reviews/` directory should likely be added to `.gitignore` if it's intended for generated content.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Split the commit into smaller, atomic commits** with accurate and descriptive messages that reflect the actual changes made.
*   **Improve commit hygiene.** Ensure every commit message accurately describes the changes within it. A developer looking at the git history would be completely misled by the current message.
*   **Revert this commit** and re-commit the changes in separate, logical units.
*   **Avoid committing generated artifacts.** Consider adding the `reviews/` directory to `.gitignore` to prevent these files from being accidentally tracked.
