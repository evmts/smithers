# Review of Commit `acf91fb`

## Summary
The changes implement the "Reference Libraries" pattern as described, adding Vercel AI SDK as a submodule and documenting the comparison with TanStack AI. However, there is a **critical issue** with the `.gitmodules` configuration that breaks project portability.

## Issues

### 1. Absolute Paths in `.gitmodules`
**File:** `.gitmodules`
**Severity:** Critical

The submodule configuration uses absolute system paths, which will break the repository for any other user or if you move the project directory.

```ini
[submodule "/Users/williamcory/smithers2/reference/vercel-ai-sdk"]
	path = /Users/williamcory/smithers2/reference/vercel-ai-sdk
	url = https://github.com/vercel/ai.git
```

**Suggested Improvement:**
Change the paths to be relative to the project root.

```ini
[submodule "reference/vercel-ai-sdk"]
	path = reference/vercel-ai-sdk
	url = https://github.com/vercel/ai.git
```

### 2. `bunfig.toml` Exclusion Pattern
**File:** `bunfig.toml`
**Severity:** Minor / Observation

The change from `**/reference/**` to `reference/` is cleaner for the specific top-level folder but stricter. Ensure that if you ever have nested reference folders in other packages (if this becomes a monorepo), they are handled intentionally. For now, this change is LGTM as it aligns with the directory structure.

## Conclusion
The content in `CLAUDE.md` and the research document is excellent and well-written. Please fix the `.gitmodules` paths to be relative to ensure the repository remains portable.
