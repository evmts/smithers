## Feedback

- `bash/important-memories.md`: This entry asserts tests/CI/build/status details and repo state without evidence in the commit. If this log is meant to be authoritative, include references (e.g., links to CI run IDs/commands) or rephrase to “reported/claimed” to avoid misleading documentation.
