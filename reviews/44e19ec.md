## Feedback

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` refers to “Smithers” and `https://github.com/williamcory/smithers.git`; if this repo is actually `plue-jsx`, update the project name and clone URL to avoid misleading contributors.
- The instructions reference `hooks/post-commit`; if that file doesn’t exist in the repo, either add it or remove that step so setup doesn’t fail.
