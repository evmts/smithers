**Commit Message:** fix(Smithers): add stop request check before execution

---

- **Summary**: The commit adds a comprehensive testing audit document and a code review file. However, the commit message is completely unrelated to the changes, making the git history misleading.
- **Specific issues found**:
    - **Inaccurate Commit Message**: The commit message `fix(Smithers): add stop request check before execution` does not describe the changes made. The commit adds `TESTING.md` and a review file under `reviews/`. It does not contain any code changes related to a "stop request check".
- **Suggested improvements**:
    - The commit message should be amended to accurately reflect the changes. A more suitable message would be `docs: add testing audit and code review`. Using the `docs` type is more appropriate than `fix` for this kind of change.
