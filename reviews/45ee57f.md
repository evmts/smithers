**Message:** 🐛 fix: advertise tool support in MCP client capabilities and fix docs
**Date:** 2026-01-05 23:40:08 UTC

## Feedback

- `src/mcp/manager.ts:61`: Adding `capabilities.sampling.tools` advertises support for `sampling/createMessage` with tools, but this client never registers a sampling handler. Servers may now attempt sampling and get “no handler” errors. Either implement a `sampling/createMessage` handler (or delegate to your LLM layer), or only advertise `sampling`/`sampling.tools` when that capability is actually supported (possibly behind config).
