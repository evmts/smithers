# Code Review for Commit 68fe980

**Commit Message:** Fix: Update Stop and Human tests to use intrinsic elements (components now require SmithersProvider)

---

### Summary

The commit has two main purposes:
1.  It updates tests for the `<Stop>` and `<Human>` components to test the underlying intrinsic elements (`<smithers-stop>` and `<human>`) directly. This is a reasonable change to adapt to a new requirement where the components need a `SmithersProvider` context, which would complicate unit testing.
2.  It performs a wide-ranging update across the documentation, changing package import paths and adding several new documentation files for components like `<Notes>`, `<PhaseRegistryProvider>`, and `<WorktreeProvider>`.

The code and documentation changes themselves appear to be correct and represent an improvement. However, the commit message is inaccurate and does not reflect the scope of the changes.

### Issues

-   **Incomplete and Misleading Commit Message**: The commit message, `Fix: Update Stop and Human tests to use intrinsic elements (components now require SmithersProvider)`, only describes the changes made in `src/components/components.test.tsx`. It completely omits the significant documentation refactor, where dozens of files were updated to change import paths, and the addition of three new component documentation pages. This makes the git history hard to follow and understand.

### Suggested Improvements

-   **Split the Commit**: Ideally, the test fixes and the documentation changes should be in separate commits. This would create a cleaner, more logical git history where each commit has a single, clear purpose.
    -   Commit 1: `fix(test): Update Stop and Human tests to use intrinsic elements`
    -   Commit 2: `feat(docs): Unify imports and add docs for new components`

-   **Improve Commit Message**: If the changes must remain in a single commit, the message should be updated to be more descriptive of the full scope of work. For example:

    ```
    feat(docs): Unify imports and add new component documentation

    - Updates all documentation examples to use a single entry point `smithers-orchestrator` for imports.
    - Adds new documentation pages for `Git Notes`, `PhaseRegistry`, and `WorktreeProvider`.
    - Updates `mint.json` to include the new pages.

    fix(test): Update Stop/Human tests to use intrinsic elements

    The `<Stop>` and `<Human>` components now require a `SmithersProvider`. The related tests have been updated to test the underlying intrinsic elements directly, which avoids the need to wrap them in a provider for these specific unit tests.
    ```
