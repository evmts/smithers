# Code Review for Commit 3482c1d

**Date:** 2026-01-18 21:38:34
**Commit Message:** Fix: SQL LIKE pattern injection in memories.search

---

### Summary

The commit is problematic. The commit message, "Fix: SQL LIKE pattern injection in memories.search," is completely unrelated to the changes presented in the diff. The commit bundles several disparate changes: minor refactors in reporting, the addition of a build configuration file, and the inclusion of a generated code review file. This mixing of concerns obscures the repository's history. The actual fix mentioned in the commit message is absent.

### Issues Found

1.  **Incorrect Commit Message**: The commit message is `Fix: SQL LIKE pattern injection in memories.search`, but none of the provided code changes address an SQL injection vulnerability or relate to a `memories.search` function. The changes are entirely different.

2.  **Mixing Unrelated Concerns**: The commit combines three distinct and unrelated types of changes, which should be in separate commits for a clean, understandable git history.
    *   **Refactoring:** Small adjustments to report types in `useCherryPickMerge.ts` and `useStackedRebase.ts`.
    *   **Build Configuration:** Addition of a new `tsconfig.json` for the `scripts` directory.
    *   **Generated Artifacts:** Addition of a code review file (`reviews/20260118_210239_3cbfd48.md`).

3.  **Committing Generated Artifacts**:
    *   **File**: `reviews/20260118_210239_3cbfd48.md`
    *   **Issue**: This file appears to be a generated review of another commit. Committing such transient artifacts adds unnecessary noise to the repository and is generally considered poor practice.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Split the Commit**: The commit should be broken down into smaller, atomic commits, each with an accurate message:
    1.  A commit for the reporting changes in the `useCherryPickMerge.ts` and `useStackedRebase.ts` hooks (e.g., `refactor: Adjust report types for merge and rebase hooks`).
    2.  A commit for the new `scripts/tsconfig.json` file (e.g., `build: Add tsconfig for scripts directory`).
*   **Do Not Commit Review Files**: The `reviews/20260118_210239_3cbfd48.md` file should be removed from the commit. Consider adding the `reviews/` directory to your `.gitignore` file to prevent these from being accidentally committed in the future.
*   **Create a Separate Commit for the Bug Fix**: The "SQL LIKE pattern injection" fix should be implemented and committed separately with the original, now-accurate, commit message.
