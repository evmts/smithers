## Feedback

`src/core/execute.ts`: adding `args.push('--', branch)` (and `--` before `baseBranch`) after `absolutePath` can break `git worktree add` because `--` is treated as a positional arg/commit-ish once the path has been consumed, so `git` may try to resolve `--` as a commit and error. Fix by moving the separator before the first positional arg and keep it there: e.g. build args as `['worktree','add', ...(branchExists?[]:['-b',branch]), '--', absolutePath, branchExists?branch:baseBranch]`, and drop the later `--` inserts.
