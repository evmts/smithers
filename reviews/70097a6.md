## Feedback

- `docs/examples/07-git-helper.mdx`: `operation` is never used to set `command`, so the helper always runs the status branch. Initialize state from `operation` (or set it on mount) and remove the unused prop if you don’t need it.
- `docs/examples/07-git-helper.mdx`: for `branch`/`log`/`diff` paths there’s no `onFinished` transition to `done`, so once you start using `operation`, those branches can re-run or never finish. Add `onFinished={() => setCommand('done')}` (or avoid state for one-shot commands).
- `docs/examples/06-file-processor.mdx`: the processing phase ignores Claude’s output and writes `Processed: ${file}` placeholders, which doesn’t match the described transformations. Use `result.text` (or structured output per file) to populate `processedContent`.
