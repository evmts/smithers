**Commit:** 8267869c00506c9016289efb47d671c890188d4c
**Message:** 🐛 fix(tests): address output-file-components review issues
**Date:** 2026-01-06 02:54:44 UTC

## Feedback

- `evals/output-file-components.test.tsx:373` and `evals/output-file-components.test.tsx:414` now run `executePlan(..., { mockMode: true })`, but in mock mode `executeFileNode` returns early and never hits the error path. This makes the “onError callback on failure” test invalid (it will never call `onError`). Run that test without mock mode if you want to exercise real FS errors.
- `evals/output-file-components.test.tsx:401` changes the invalid path to a nested path under `testDir`, but `executeFileNode` always creates parent dirs and doesn’t honor `createDirs` (no `createDirs` handling exists in `src/`). So even without mock mode, this path will succeed, not fail. Use a reliably failing target (e.g., create a directory at the path and then write to that same path to trigger EISDIR), or implement `createDirs` and disable it in the test.
