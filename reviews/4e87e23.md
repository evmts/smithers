**Message:** chore: Add Session 2026-01-07 Evening Comprehensive Status Check to memories

## Feedback

The added entry is internally inconsistent and misleading: it claims “Test Coverage … 0 failures” and “Production Readiness 100%” while also listing “20 fail (all SolidJS)” in the same section. Please reconcile these statements in `bash/important-memories.md` so the record matches the actual test status (either update the counts or remove the “0 failures/100%” claims).
