## Feedback

The new claims look potentially inaccurate or too specific without citations. In particular, “V8 v12.3+ deprecated `assert`, planned removal by v12.6” and the exact Node/V8 version cutoffs may be wrong or already outdated. Please either verify and cite authoritative sources or soften the wording (e.g., “V8 has announced deprecation” without exact versions).
