**Message:** docs: Add comprehensive TUI integration research and design
**Date:** 2026-01-08 04:02:09 UTC

## Feedback

- Removing frontmatter likely breaks docs metadata/indexing if your docs pipeline expects it; restore the `title`/`description` block or confirm the docs system no longer needs it in `docs/tui-design.md` and `docs/vhs-recording.md`.
- The OpenTUI example shows `createRoot(domElement)` but `@opentui/react`’s `createRoot` expects a renderer (as shown earlier in the same doc); update the snippet to `createRoot(renderer)` to avoid a misleading integration example in `docs/tui-research.md`.
