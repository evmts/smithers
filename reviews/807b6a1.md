# Review: 807b6a1

**Commit:** 807b6a17de883bc0c23f7dd12c3c2bdffd6818bd
**Message:** refactor: rename project from Plue to Smithers
**Date:** 2026-01-05 23:06:55 UTC

## Feedback

- `bash/ralph-prompt.md` still says “Plue” throughout and includes the old rename checklist removed elsewhere. For a full rename, update this prompt to “Smithers” and remove the obsolete rename section.  
- `bash/ralph.sh` fallback prompt still says “productionizing Plue.” Update to “Smithers” to match the new branding.  
- `docs/concepts.md` still says “Plue agents are MDX files…” in the body text even though imports changed. Update the prose to “Smithers” to avoid mixed branding.
