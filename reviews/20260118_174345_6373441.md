### Summary

The commit adds valuable documentation for external dependencies and includes new reference libraries as git submodules. This is a positive step for the project's maintainability. However, there is an inconsistency between the commit message/documentation and the actual changes, along with a minor formatting error.

### Issues

1.  **Missing `vercel-ai-sdk` Submodule:**
    - The commit message states, "Initialize Vercel AI SDK submodule (reference/vercel-ai-sdk)," and `CLAUDE.md` is updated to include it as a reference library. However, the corresponding change to add this submodule is missing from the `.gitmodules` file. Only the `anthropic-sdk-typescript` submodule is added in this commit.

2.  **Markdown Formatting Error:**
    - **File:** `CLAUDE.md`
    - **Line:** `+ [ @babel/core](https://github.com/babel/babel) (^7.28.6) - JavaScript transpiler`
    - There is an extra space before `@babel/core` inside the markdown link, which may affect rendering. It should be `[@babel/core]`.

### Suggested Improvements

1.  Add the `reference/vercel-ai-sdk` submodule to `.gitmodules` to align with the commit message and documentation.
2.  Correct the markdown formatting typo in `CLAUDE.md` by removing the leading space.

## Status: RESOLVED

**Evidence:**

1. **vercel-ai-sdk submodule** - Now present in `.gitmodules`:
   ```
   [submodule "reference/vercel-ai-sdk"]
   	path = reference/vercel-ai-sdk
   	url = https://github.com/vercel/ai.git
   ```

2. **Markdown formatting** - `[@babel/core]` is correctly formatted at line 189 of CLAUDE.md (no leading space)
