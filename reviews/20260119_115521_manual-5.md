# Review: index re-exports disallowed hooks

sev: low
file: src/reconciler/index.ts:31-41

issue: useState/useEffect exported despite project policy (no useState, avoid useEffect); makes misuse easy.
flow: consumer imports from reconciler -> policy violation.

risk: inconsistent state mgmt, drift from DB/reactive hooks.
fix: remove these re-exports or enforce via lint/TS rule.
