**Message:** chore: Add Session 2026-01-07 Comprehensive Verification to memories
**Date:** 2026-01-07 18:00:45 UTC

## Feedback

The entry claims “Production Readiness: 100% COMPLETE” and “Comprehensive verification found ZERO gaps,” but also states “tests: 751 pass, 2 skip, 20 fail.” That’s contradictory. Please reconcile by either fixing/acknowledging the failing tests or updating the readiness/verification claims to reflect the failures.
