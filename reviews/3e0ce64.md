## Feedback

- `evals/loader.test.ts:64` The “undefined component” MDX test expects `loadAgentFile` to throw, but `extractElement` only creates a React element (it does not render), so missing components won’t error at load time. Either render the element in the test (or via a renderer) to trigger the runtime error, or change the expectation to reflect load-time behavior.
- `evals/loader.test.ts:116` The missing-import test is explicitly non-deterministic due to tree-shaking, so it doesn’t reliably exercise the error path. Consider using the imported symbol (or a side-effect import) to force resolution so the loader’s error formatting is actually tested.
- `bash/important-memories.md:191` The entry says `Commit: 01ca917`, which doesn’t match this commit. Update the hash or keep `[current]` to avoid confusing history.
