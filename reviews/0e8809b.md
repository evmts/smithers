## Feedback

- Bug: topics never transition to `in_progress`, so when any other topic completes and triggers a re-render, still-running topics remain `pending` and will be rendered again, potentially spawning duplicate subagents for the same topic. Mark a topic as started before launching its `TopicResearcher`, or set status to `in_progress` at the start of `TopicResearcher`. File: `examples/04-parallel-research/agent.tsx`.
