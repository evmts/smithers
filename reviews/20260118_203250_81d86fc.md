**Commit Message:** fix(tools): validate execute is function in isCustomTool

---

### Summary

The code changes remove what appear to be unused imports from two test files. While the changes themselves look like routine code cleanup, the commit message is entirely unrelated to the content of the diff, which is a significant issue for maintainability of the codebase.

### Specific Issues Found

*   **Misleading Commit Message:** The commit message is `fix(tools): validate execute is function in isCustomTool`, but the changes are only in `src/db/query.test.ts` and `src/db/utils.test.ts`. The changes involve removing unused imports and have nothing to do with "tools" or validating an `execute` function. This makes the Git history confusing and untrustworthy, which can hinder future debugging and code archaeology.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Correct the Commit Message:** The commit message should be amended to accurately reflect the changes. A more appropriate message would be something like: `chore(db): remove unused imports from test files`.
*   **Verify Commit Contents:** The developer should confirm that these changes were intended to be a standalone commit. It's possible these cleanup changes were accidentally included with an unrelated commit message, and the actual fix described in the commit message is missing. The commit should either be amended to include the correct files, or the message should be changed to describe these removals.
