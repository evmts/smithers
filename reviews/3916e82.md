**Message:** fix: clear blocked node errors when worktree is fixed
**Date:** 2026-01-07 00:08:14 UTC

## Feedback

- `src/core/execute.ts`: Using `error.message.includes('parent worktree failed')` is brittle; if wording changes or another error contains that substring you’ll clear `_execution` incorrectly. Prefer a structured flag/code on the error (e.g., `error.code === 'PARENT_WORKTREE_FAILED'`) or a dedicated boolean on the node to indicate “blocked by parent worktree.”
- `src/core/execute.ts`: `delete node._execution` drops all execution metadata, not just the error. If you rely on other fields (e.g., timing, content hash, counters) this could cause regressions. Consider clearing only `status`/`error` or resetting to a known “pending” state.
