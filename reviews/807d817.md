**Message:** 📝 fix(docs): add OutputFormat to phases expecting structured results
**Date:** 2026-01-06 02:55:24 UTC

## Feedback

docs/examples/feature-workflow.mdx: the new `OutputFormat` schemas leave several arrays without `items` types (e.g., `refinedPlan.steps/testCases/apis/risks`), which weakens validation. Consider specifying `items` and (optionally) `required` fields for each schema to make the contract enforceable.
