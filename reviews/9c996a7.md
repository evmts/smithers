## Feedback

- Backward-compat risk: `onHumanPrompt.length >= 2` will treat legacy callbacks defined as `(message) => ...` (or ones with default/rest params that reduce `.length`) as “enhanced” and pass a `HumanPromptInfo` object, which will break existing 1-arg consumers. Consider an explicit opt-in flag, or keep legacy default unless a dedicated option indicates enhanced mode, or add a second callback prop for the enhanced signature. File: `src/core/execute.ts`.
- `rateLimit`/`usageLimit` reactivity only updates when the new prop is truthy; if a user removes these props (undefined) to disable limits, the old limiter config persists. Consider handling the `undefined` case (reset/disable) so prop removal takes effect. File: `src/context/claude-provider.tsx`.
