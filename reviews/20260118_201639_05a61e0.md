**Commit Message:** fix(Smithers): add safe JSON.parse for result_structured

---

- **Summary**: The commit adds a code review document for a previous commit. While adding review files seems to be a convention for this project, the commit message is entirely unrelated to the changes.
- **Specific issues found**:
    - **Inaccurate Commit Message**: The commit message `fix(Smithers): add safe JSON.parse for result_structured` does not in any way describe the change being made, which is the addition of a markdown file (`reviews/20260118_201534_bf6ceb6.md`). This makes the git history misleading and difficult to follow.
- **Suggested improvements**:
    - The commit message should be amended to accurately describe the change. A better message would be something like: `docs(review): add review for commit bf6ceb6`.
