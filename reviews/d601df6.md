**Message:** ✨ feat(execute): integrate workflow outputs and provider context

## Feedback

Workflow-output tools never set `workflowValuesSet` during real executions, so the rerender/state-changed path won’t trigger when a model uses `set_*` tools. In `generateWorkflowTools` you need a way to flip that flag (e.g., capture a setter via closure or have `executeNode` wrap tool executes to mark `workflowValuesSet = true` when `store.setValue` is called). As-is, only mock mode marks it.

Also, `zodSchemaToToolSchema(schema)` is called even when `schema` is `undefined`. If that helper doesn’t accept `undefined`, this will throw when a workflow-output omits a schema. Consider guarding it or returning a default schema.
