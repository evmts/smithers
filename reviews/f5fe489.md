## Feedback

- `examples/04-parallel-research/agent.tsx`: topics are never marked `in_progress`, so `pendingTopics` never shrinks; each render can re-create the same `<Subagent>` and potentially run duplicate research. Set status to `in_progress` when a topic starts, and filter by `pending`/`in_progress` appropriately.
- `examples/04-parallel-research/agent.tsx`: `ParallelResearchAgent` calls `useStore.getState().nextPhase()` inside render. That’s a state update during render and can cause extra frames or warnings. Trigger phase advance in an effect or via the completion callbacks only.
