# Review: 9735bcb

**Commit:** 9735bcb3eb79616fbb649fa114b59d3f9c47c519
**Message:** docs: Add session summaries documenting production-ready verification
**Date:** 2026-01-08 03:34:53 UTC

## Feedback

- `bash/important-memories.md`: inconsistent test file count (35 in the added summary vs 34 later in the same section and in `bash/session-2026-01-07-1928.md`). Pick one number and align all mentions.
- `bash/important-memories.md`: “663 tests passing, 2 skipped” conflicts with “Zero failing tests”/“All 663 tests passing” elsewhere; clarify skipped vs passing counts consistently.
- `bash/session-2026-01-07-1930.md`: component count mismatch (claims 16 components here vs “15 total” in `bash/session-2026-01-07-1928.md`); reconcile the component list and the total.
