# Review: 35bb470

**Commit:** 35bb470d939105fe13c526d695d1cc0aa688fdea
**Message:** docs: Update RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md with accurate test count
**Date:** 2026-01-07 16:46:29 UTC

## Feedback

- Inconsistent test status phrasing: “All 663 tests passing” conflicts with “2 skip, 0 fail”; update wording to reflect skips (e.g., “663 pass, 2 skip, 0 fail”) in `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md:6`.
- Commit message claims a note about 20 failing OpenTUI SolidJS tests, but no such note appears in the doc; either add the note or drop the claim to avoid misleading release status in `RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md:6`.
- “All tests passing” language repeats in the session log despite skips and mention of dependency failures; align wording for accuracy in `bash/important-memories.md:1690` and `bash/important-memories.md:1701`.
