## Feedback

- `examples/08-test-generator/agent.tsx`: `frameworkInstructions` references itself in the initializer (`|| frameworkInstructions.bun`), which is a runtime `ReferenceError`. Fix by defaulting to a literal, e.g. `|| 'Use Bun test syntax...'`.
- `examples/08-test-generator/agent.tsx`: `testFilePath` drops the `x` for `.tsx`/`.jsx` (`.test.ts` instead of `.test.tsx`). Use a safer replacement that preserves the full extension, e.g. capture `tsx|jsx|ts|js`.
- `examples/06-file-processor/agent.tsx`: `onWritten` sets `phase` to `done` on the first write because `processedContent` already contains all files; this can unmount remaining `<File>` components and skip writes. Track a separate written counter or move the “done” logic outside individual `onWritten`.
- `examples/11-rate-limited-batch/agent.tsx`: when `inputPath` is a directory, the code passes file paths as items but never reads file contents; the model only sees the path string. If the intent is to process file content (per README), read each file and pass its contents.
