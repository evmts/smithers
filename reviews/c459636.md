# Review: c459636

**Commit:** c4596366e254bf14f2df1bf1cffaea72f3ddb4d0
**Message:** 📦 chore(deps): add claude-agent-sdk dependency
**Date:** 2026-01-06 01:26:02 UTC

## Feedback

Commit adds dependency but also changes repository/homepage/bugs URLs. That’s unrelated to “add claude-agent-sdk” and can be a breaking metadata change (publishing links). Split this into a separate commit or revert if unintended.  
`package.json:36,39,42`
