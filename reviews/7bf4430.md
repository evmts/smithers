# Review: 7bf4430

**Commit:** 7bf4430c6926a8cd58d2dc9ce571636ae18130db
**Message:** docs: fix example code issues in git-helper and file-processor
**Date:** 2026-01-07 03:42:51 UTC

## Feedback

- Bug: `docs/examples/07-git-helper.mdx` initializes `initializedRef` inside render, so it resets every render and calls `setCommand` repeatedly (can cause render loop / state thrash). Use `useRef` + `useEffect` to initialize once, or just `useEffect` keyed by `operation`.
- Fragile parsing: `docs/examples/06-file-processor.mdx` builds `RegExp` from raw `filename`, so regex metacharacters in filenames will break matching. Escape the filename before building the regex.
- Likely mismatch with prompt: `docs/examples/06-file-processor.mdx` expects the filename to appear at line start, but the prompt says “filename as a header,” which Claude will often format as `# filename.md`. The regex won’t match and will fall back to `resultText` for every file. Allow optional heading markers (e.g. `^#+\\s*`) or switch to a structured output format (JSON or `---` separators).
