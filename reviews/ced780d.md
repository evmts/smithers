## Feedback

The added section contradicts itself: it claims “100% production‑ready” and “No outstanding work items,” but then lists blockers (VHS demo generation, npm credentials). Either remove the “no outstanding work items/100% complete” language or reclassify those as required vs optional with a clear status so the doc is consistent.
