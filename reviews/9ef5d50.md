**Message:** ✨ feat: add config system, Stop component, and fix MCP tool scoping

## Feedback

- Duplicate tool names are still passed to Anthropic even after warning, because inline tools are appended (not replacing) and `convertTools` will include both entries; this can cause API errors or undefined behavior with duplicate tool names. Consider de-duping and replacing the MCP entry when an inline tool collides, so only one tool definition is sent. `src/core/execute.ts:566`
- `smithers.config.ts` is advertised but loaded via dynamic `import()` without a TS loader; Node won’t execute `.ts` configs by default, so this will throw at runtime unless users add a loader. Either drop `.ts` support, document the required loader, or transpile/require via a supported path. `src/cli/config.ts:158`
