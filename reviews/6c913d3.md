# Review: 6c913d3

**Commit:** 6c913d352ec8279f91e582ac576026ff5c0e8d14
**Message:** docs: add comprehensive changeset for major release
**Date:** 2026-01-07 02:33:48 UTC

## Feedback

Deletion of `reviews/de95eee.md` looks unrelated to the changeset and removes prior review feedback. If the intent is just to add a release changeset, keep that review file (or move it to an archive) and limit the commit to `.changeset/major-tui-and-examples.md` plus any necessary docs updates.
