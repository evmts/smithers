### Summary

The provided code change is a minor text simplification in a documentation review script. However, this change is completely unrelated to the commit message, which describes adding a `useSnapshot` feature for the `jj` integration. This mismatch indicates a significant issue with the commit's structure, making the repository history misleading.

### Issues

*   **Commit Message Mismatch:** The change modifies a prompt string in `scripts/docs-review.tsx`. The commit message, `feat(jj): add useSnapshot() for out-of-loop JJ state access`, is entirely unrelated to this change. This makes it difficult to understand the purpose of the commit and track the history of the `jj` feature or the documentation script.

### Suggested Improvements

*   **Split the Commit:** The change to `scripts/docs-review.tsx` should be moved to a separate commit with a descriptive message, for example: `chore(docs): Refine documentation review prompt`. The `jj`-related feature work should be in its own commit that aligns with the provided commit message. This will ensure the git history is clean, accurate, and easy for other developers to follow.
