# Review: serialize inserts newlines between adjacent TEXT

issue: children joined with '\n' including TEXT siblings; prompt content changes.
flow: TEXT("a") + TEXT("b") -> join("\n") -> "a\nb".

risk: plan/prompt text mutated (extra newlines), especially for adjacent literals.
fix: join children without unconditional newline; concat adjacent TEXT or preserve original whitespace.
