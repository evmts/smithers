**Commit Message:** docs: add issue for re-exporting Vercel AI SDK React hooks

---

I will read `package.json` to verify the package name and `issues/chat-transport.md` to check the issue format convention.
I will list the directory `src/hooks` to verify the existence of `index.ts`.
The plan to re-export `@ai-sdk/react` hooks is sound and well-structured, but the markdown file contains syntax errors in the code examples and unrelated file references that should be corrected before the plan is used for implementation.

### Issues

**1. Invalid Package Name in Code Blocks**
The code examples consistently include a leading space in the package name `' @ai-sdk/react'`, which is invalid and will cause errors if copy-pasted.

*   **Location**: `issues/reexport-react-hooks.md` (Multiple occurrences)
    *   `" @ai-sdk/react": "^1.0.0"` (Phase 1)
    *   `from ' @ai-sdk/react'` (Phase 2, Phase 5)
    *   `import { useChat } from ' @ai-sdk/react'` (Migration)

**2. Unrelated `@reference` Tags**
The issue uses `@reference` tags that point to files completely unrelated to the context. This appears to be a hallucination or copy-paste error.
*   **Location**: `issues/reexport-react-hooks.md`
    *   `@reference/vercel-ai-sdk/packages/deepseek/src/deepseek-provider.ts` is used for the React hooks documentation link.
    *   `@reference/vercel-ai-sdk/packages/provider-utils/.../default.ts` is used for the `logToDb` boolean property.

### Suggested Improvements

1.  **Fix Package Imports**: Remove the leading space from all `@ai-sdk/react` strings.
    ```typescript
    // Change this:
    from ' @ai-sdk/react';
    // To this:
    from '@ai-sdk/react';
    ```

2.  **Cleanup References**: Remove the unrelated `@reference` tags or point them to relevant files (e.g., `reference/vercel-ai-sdk/packages/react/src/index.ts`) if intended to provide context.
