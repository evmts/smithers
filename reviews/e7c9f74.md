## Feedback

- `src/cli/loader.ts`: `import(filePath)` with an absolute path will fail under Node ESM (requires a file URL). Since the build targets Node, CLI will break outside Bun. Use `pathToFileURL(absolutePath).href` (or prefix `file://`) for the dynamic import.  
- `src/core/claude-executor.ts`: `stream: true` doesn’t actually stream; it calls `client.messages.create` and only invokes `onStream` after the full response is available. Either implement the streaming API or remove/rename the option to avoid misleading behavior.  
- `src/core/claude-executor.ts`: Tool result serialization does `JSON.stringify(result)` without a guard; circular structures or `BigInt` will throw and abort execution. Wrap in try/catch and fall back to a safe string.
