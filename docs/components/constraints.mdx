# Constraints Component

The `<Constraints>` component defines rules and limitations for the agent's behavior. It sets boundaries on what the agent should and shouldn't do.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { Claude, Constraints } from 'smithers'

<Claude>
  <Constraints>
    - Never modify production data directly
    - Always explain your reasoning before suggesting changes
    - Keep responses under 500 words unless asked for more detail
    - If requirements are ambiguous, ask clarifying questions
    - Prioritize security over convenience
  </Constraints>

  Help me refactor this database migration...
</Claude>
```

Renders to:

```xml
<claude>
  <constraints>
    - Never modify production data directly
    - Always explain your reasoning before suggesting changes
    - Keep responses under 500 words unless asked for more detail
    - If requirements are ambiguous, ask clarifying questions
    - Prioritize security over convenience
  </constraints>

  Help me refactor this database migration...
</claude>
```

## Props

<ParamField path="children" type="ReactNode" required>
  The constraint rules, typically as a bulleted list.
</ParamField>

## Reusable Constraint Sets

Create reusable constraint components for common patterns:

```tsx
// constraints.tsx
import { Constraints } from 'smithers'

export function SafeCodeConstraints() {
  return (
    <Constraints>
      - No destructive operations without explicit confirmation
      - Always create backups before modifying files
      - Test changes in isolation before applying broadly
      - Log all significant actions for audit trails
    </Constraints>
  )
}

export function StyleConstraints({ style }) {
  return (
    <Constraints>
      - Follow {style} style guide
      - Use consistent naming conventions
      - Add comments for complex logic only
      - Prefer readability over cleverness
    </Constraints>
  )
}

export function ConciseConstraints() {
  return (
    <Constraints>
      - Be direct and concise
      - Skip unnecessary preamble
      - Use bullet points for lists
      - Only elaborate when asked
    </Constraints>
  )
}
```

### Using Reusable Constraints

```tsx
import { SafeCodeConstraints, StyleConstraints } from './constraints'

<Claude tools={[filesystem]}>
  <SafeCodeConstraints />
  <StyleConstraints style="Airbnb" />

  Refactor the authentication module...
</Claude>
```

## Common Constraint Patterns

### Security Constraints

```tsx
<Constraints>
  - Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
  - Validate all user inputs before processing
  - Use parameterized queries, never string concatenation
  - Check authorization before every operation
</Constraints>
```

### Output Constraints

```tsx
<Constraints>
  - Keep responses under 200 words
  - Use markdown formatting for code
  - Include examples for every suggestion
  - End with a summary of key points
</Constraints>
```

### Safety Constraints

```tsx
<Constraints>
  - Never delete files without confirmation
  - Always show a diff before applying changes
  - Refuse to execute commands that could harm the system
  - Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
</Constraints>
```

## Combining with Other Components

```tsx
function CodeReviewer({ files }) {
  return (
    <Claude tools={[filesystem, grep]}>
      <Persona role="Senior Code Reviewer" />

      <Constraints>
        - Focus on maintainability and readability
        - Don't nitpick formatting issues
        - Provide specific code examples for suggestions
        - Prioritize bugs over style issues
      </Constraints>

      Review these files: {files.join(', ')}

      <OutputFormat>
        Return markdown with sections for:
        - Critical issues
        - Suggestions
        - Positive highlights
      </OutputFormat>
    </Claude>
  )
}
```

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Keep constraints actionable" icon="list-check">
    Each constraint should be something Claude can actually follow
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use positive framing" icon="thumbs-up">
    "Do X" is often clearer than "Don't do Y"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prioritize constraints" icon="sort">
    Put the most important constraints first
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be specific" icon="bullseye">
    "Keep responses under 200 words" is better than "Be brief"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
