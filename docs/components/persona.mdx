# Persona Component

The `<Persona>` component defines a role or persona for Claude to adopt. Personas are rendered as part of the system message and help guide Claude's behavior and expertise.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Persona } from "smithers-orchestrator";

<Claude>
  <Persona role="security expert">
    You specialize in application security, penetration testing, and secure code review.
    Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and security best practices.
  </Persona>

  Review this authentication code for security issues.
</Claude>
```

## Props

<ParamField path="role" type="string">
  A short name for the persona role (e.g., "security expert", "senior engineer").
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="children" type="ReactNode">
  Detailed description of the persona's expertise, focus areas, and behavior.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Security Expert

```tsx
<Claude>
  <Persona role="security expert">
    You are a security researcher with expertise in:
    - Web application security
    - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
    - Secure coding practices
    - Penetration testing methodology

    Always prioritize security over convenience.
  </Persona>

  Audit this API endpoint for security vulnerabilities.
</Claude>
```

### Code Reviewer

```tsx
<Claude>
  <Persona role="senior code reviewer">
    You are a senior engineer performing thorough code reviews.
    Focus on:
    - Code correctness and logic errors
    - Performance implications
    - Maintainability and readability
    - Test coverage gaps

    Be constructive but thorough in feedback.
  </Persona>

  Review this pull request.
</Claude>
```

### Domain Expert

```tsx
<Claude>
  <Persona role="database optimization specialist">
    You specialize in database performance optimization with deep expertise in:
    - Query optimization and indexing strategies
    - Database schema design
    - N+1 query detection and resolution
    - Connection pooling and caching
  </Persona>

  Analyze these slow queries and suggest optimizations.
</Claude>
```

## Combining with Constraints

Personas work well with the `<Constraints>` component:

```tsx
<Claude>
  <Persona role="technical writer">
    You write clear, concise technical documentation.
  </Persona>

  <Constraints>
    - Use simple language
    - Include code examples
    - Keep explanations under 200 words
  </Constraints>

  Document this API endpoint.
</Claude>
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific about expertise">
    Instead of "You are an expert", specify what kind of expert:
    ```tsx
    // Good
    <Persona role="React performance specialist">
      You specialize in React performance optimization, including:
      - Virtual DOM optimization
      - Memoization strategies
      - Bundle size reduction
    </Persona>

    // Less effective
    <Persona role="expert">
      You are an expert developer.
    </Persona>
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include behavioral guidance">
    Tell Claude how to behave, not just what it knows:
    ```tsx
    <Persona role="patient mentor">
      You are a patient teacher who explains concepts step by step.
      Always check for understanding before moving on.
      Use analogies when explaining complex topics.
    </Persona>
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Match persona to task">
    Choose personas that align with the task at hand:
    ```tsx
    // For code review
    <Persona role="meticulous code reviewer" />

    // For creative tasks
    <Persona role="innovative architect" />

    // For debugging
    <Persona role="systematic debugger" />
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
