# Persona Component

The `<Persona>` component defines the agent's role and expertise. It helps create consistent, in-character responses by establishing who the agent is.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { Claude, Persona } from '@evmts/smithers'

<Claude>
  <Persona role="Senior Security Engineer">
    You have 15 years of experience in application security.
    You've worked at major tech companies and consulted for Fortune 500s.
    You prioritize practical, actionable advice over theoretical perfection.
  </Persona>

  Review this authentication implementation...
</Claude>
```

Renders to:

```xml
<claude>
  <persona role="Senior Security Engineer">
    You have 15 years of experience in application security.
    You've worked at major tech companies and consulted for Fortune 500s.
    You prioritize practical, actionable advice over theoretical perfection.
  </persona>

  Review this authentication implementation...
</claude>
```

## Props

<ParamField path="role" type="string" required>
  The persona's role or title.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="children" type="JSX.Element">
  Additional details about the persona's background, expertise, or approach.
</ParamField>

## Reusable Personas

Create a library of reusable personas for your domain:

```tsx
// personas.tsx
import { Persona } from '@evmts/smithers'

export function SecurityExpert(props) {
  return (
    <Persona role="Security Expert">
      Senior application security engineer with expertise in OWASP Top 10,
      secure coding practices, and threat modeling.
      {props.children}
    </Persona>
  )
}

export function DatabaseArchitect(props) {
  return (
    <Persona role="Database Architect">
      15 years of experience with PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis.
      Expert in query optimization, indexing strategies, and data modeling.
      {props.children}
    </Persona>
  )
}

export function TechLead(props) {
  return (
    <Persona role="Tech Lead">
      Experienced engineering leader focused on code quality, team velocity,
      and sustainable development practices.
      {props.children}
    </Persona>
  )
}
```

### Using Reusable Personas

```tsx
import { SecurityExpert } from './personas'

<Claude tools={[filesystem]}>
  <SecurityExpert>
    Particularly focused on API security today.
  </SecurityExpert>
  Audit the API endpoints...
</Claude>
```

## Combining with Other Components

Personas work well with other structural components:

```tsx
function SecurityAudit(props) {
  return (
    <Claude tools={[filesystem, grep]}>
      <Persona role="Security Auditor">
        CISSP-certified security professional with expertise in
        web application security and secure code review.
      </Persona>

      <Constraints>
        - Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
        - Prioritize issues by severity and exploitability
        - Provide actionable remediation steps
      </Constraints>

      <Phase name="audit">
        <Step>Scan {props.codebase} for security vulnerabilities</Step>
        <Step>Analyze authentication and authorization flows</Step>
      </Phase>
    </Claude>
  )
}
```
