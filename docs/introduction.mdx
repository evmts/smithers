# Welcome to Smithers

Smithers is a **declarative JSX framework** for building AI agent orchestration workflows. Built with React, it lets you write agent workflows as composable JSX components with persistent state across sessions.

## Why Smithers?

- **Write agent workflows as JSX** - Declarative composition is easier to reason about than imperative chains
- **Let Claude Code write the orchestration** - Describe what you want, and your agent builds the workflow
- **Persist state across sessions** - Pick up where you left off, even days later
- **Mix short scripts with long-running workflows** - Same syntax for a quick task or a week-long project
- **Full observability** - Database logging and reports show exactly what your agents are doing
- **Reactive primitives** - React mean your workflows respond to state changes automatically
- **Version controlled workflows** - Workflows are just TypeScript files

## Key Features

### Claude Component

The core agent component that executes Claude with full tool access:

```tsx
<Claude
  model="sonnet"           // opus | sonnet | haiku
  maxTurns={10}            // Limit agentic loops
  permissionMode="acceptEdits"  // Auto-accept file edits
  systemPrompt="You are a senior engineer..."
  allowedTools={["Read", "Edit", "Bash"]}
  onFinished={(result) => handleResult(result)}
>
  Your prompt here
</Claude>
```

### Ralph Loop Controller

Named after Ralph Wiggum's "I'm in danger" catchphrase - controls iterative loops that could run away:

```tsx
<Ralph maxIterations={10} onMaxIterations={() => console.log("I'm in danger!")}>
  <Claude onFinished={() => { /* state change triggers next iteration */ }}>
    Keep improving until tests pass.
  </Claude>
</Ralph>
```

### Structured Output with Zod

Get typed, validated responses with automatic retry:

```tsx
const UserSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
})

<Claude schema={UserSchema} schemaRetries={2}>
  Extract user info from: John Doe (john@example.com)
</Claude>
// result.structured: { name: string, email: string }
```

### Database State Persistence

All state is saved in a SQLite database that survives restarts:

```tsx
// Set state
await db.state.set("phase", "review");

// Get state
const phase = await db.state.get("phase");

// Query history
const history = await db.state.history("phase");
```

### MCP Tool Integration

Give Claude access to external tools via Model Context Protocol:

```tsx
<Claude model="sonnet" maxTurns={5}>
  <Sqlite path="./analytics.db">
    The database contains user_events and sessions tables.
  </Sqlite>
  What are the top 10 most common user actions this week?
</Claude>
```

## How It Works

Smithers uses a custom React renderer called the "Ralph Wiggum Loop":

1. **Render**: Your JSX components render using React's rendering
2. **Execute**: `<Claude>` nodes are executed via Claude Code CLI
3. **Update**: `onFinished` callbacks update React state
4. **Re-render**: Signal changes trigger reactive updates to the tree
5. **Loop**: Back to step 2 until no pending `<Claude>` nodes remain
6. **Complete**: Execution finishes when all agents are done

This reactive model means your agent's behavior emerges from your component logic - conditionals, state machines, and composition.

## Installation Methods

### Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

```bash
# Add the Smithers marketplace
/plugin marketplace add evmts/smithers

# Install the plugin
/plugin install smithers@smithers
```

### npm Package (Programmatic)

```bash
bun add smithers-orchestrator
```
