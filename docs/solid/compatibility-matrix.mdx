# React vs Solid Compatibility

This table maps common React patterns used in Smithers to their Solid equivalents.

## Core State and Effects

| React | Solid | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useState` | `createSignal` | Signals hold values; read with `signal()` |
| `useMemo` | `createMemo` | Memo recalculates on signal reads |
| `useEffect` | `createEffect` | Runs when dependencies change |
| `useRef` | `createSignal` or `createMutable` | Prefer signals for reactive values |

## Control Flow

| React | Solid | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{condition && <X />}` | `<Show when={condition()}>{...}</Show>` | Direct conditionals also work |
| `{list.map(...)}` | `<For each={list()}>{...}</For>` | Signals for list updates |
| `Fragment` | `<></>` | Standard JSX fragment |

## Smithers Patterns

| React Smithers | Solid Smithers | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Zustand store | Signals | Use signals for shared agent state |
| Workflow outputs | Signals | Replace output plumbing with direct signals |
| React reconciler | Solid universal renderer | No VDOM diffing |

## Known Differences

- Solid JSX compilation targets renderer ops directly; no `createElement`.
- Signal reads must be invoked (`analysis()` vs `analysis`).
- Some React patterns (context providers, hooks) have Solid equivalents but are not identical.

## Migration Tips

- Start with component rewrites that replace `useState` with `createSignal`.
- Replace conditional returns with `Show` for clarity.
- Remove workflow output plumbing when signals can flow directly.
