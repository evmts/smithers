# Solid Migration Overview

Smithers can adopt Solid’s signal runtime while preserving the same XML plan output and the Ralph Wiggum loop. The Solid renderer replaces the React reconciler, but the rest of the system (serialization, execution, CLI) stays intact.

## How It Fits

- **Signals** update the plan tree directly (no VDOM diffing).
- **solid-js/universal** provides the custom renderer hooks.
- **Smithers core** keeps execution and XML serialization unchanged.

## Read Next

1. **Blueprint** for the migration plan and milestones.
2. **Renderer API** for the required SmithersNode operations.
3. **Compiler Setup** to target the Solid universal renderer.
4. **Parity Test Plan** to validate output and execution.
5. **Compatibility Matrix** to map React patterns to Solid equivalents.

## Decision Points

- Do we ship Solid renderer alongside React or replace it?
- Do we keep JSX config opt-in or make it default?
- Which examples to port first for parity validation?
