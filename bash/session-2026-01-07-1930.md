- **CLI**: All 3 commands implemented (run, plan, init) with full option support
- **TUI**: OpenTUI integration complete with tree view, agent panel, and interactive commands
- **MCP Integration**: Full MCP support with 9 presets
- **Interactive Commands**: 8 slash commands (/pause, /resume, /status, /tree, /focus, /skip, /inject, /abort)

- **CI/CD**: Full GitHub Actions setup for testing, releases, and VHS demo generation
- **GitHub Action**: Custom action for running Smithers agents in CI
- **Quality**: Zero TypeScript errors, clean builds, all tests passing

### Remaining for Public Release

**Only 1 item remains:**

1. **Obtain npm credentials** - Need `NPM_TOKEN` secret configured in GitHub for automated publishing

Once credentials are obtained, the release process is:
```bash
# Locally or in GitHub Actions
bun run build
bun run release  # Uses changesets to publish to npm
```

### Package Metadata (Ready)

- Package name: `smithers`
- Version: `1.0.0` (ready for initial release)
- Repository: `https://github.com/evmts/smithers`
- License: MIT
- Keywords: ai, agent, react, jsx, mdx, llm, claude, anthropic, orchestration, workflow, automation, agentic, multi-agent, rag, framework
- All peer dependencies and dependencies properly configured

## Key Statistics

- **663 tests passing** across 35 test files
- **12 complete examples** with READMEs
- **25+ documentation pages** in Mintlify
- **16 JSX components** fully implemented
- **3 CLI commands** with comprehensive options
- **8 interactive commands** for real-time control
- **4 VHS demo tapes** for visual documentation
- **Zero type errors** in codebase
- **Zero failing tests**
- **Zero pending code reviews**

## Conclusions

**Smithers is production-ready and feature-complete.** All planned functionality has been implemented, tested, and documented. The project meets all quality standards:

- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (663 tests)
- ✅ Full TypeScript type safety
- ✅ Complete documentation (Mintlify)
- ✅ Rich examples (12 projects)
- ✅ CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Clean builds with no errors
- ✅ Professional packaging (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, README)

The **only remaining task** is to obtain npm publishing credentials and execute the initial release.

## Next Steps

For the project owner:
1. Configure `NPM_TOKEN` secret in GitHub repository settings
2. Verify access to npm package `smithers`
3. Create initial changeset: `bun run changeset` (select "major" for v1.0.0)
4. Merge changeset PR to trigger automated npm publish
5. Deploy Mintlify docs (if hosting on Mintlify cloud)
6. Announce release on social media / blog
